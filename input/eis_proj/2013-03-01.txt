**ES.1.2 Project Description**

The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline Project consists of a 36-inch
pipeline and related facilities that would allow for transport of up to
830,000 bpd of crude oil from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
(WCSB) in Alberta, Canada, and from the Williston Basin (Bakken)
region in Montana and North Dakota, primarily to refineries in the
Gulf Coast area. There is existing demand for crude oil, particularly
heavy crude oil at refiners in the Gulf Coast area, but the ultimate
disposition of crude oil transported by the proposed Project, and any
refined products produced from that crude oil, would be determined
by future market forces.

This draft Supplemental EIS evaluates the 875-mile pipeline that would
stretch from the U.S.-Canadian border near Morgan, Montana, to the
existing Keystone pipeline in Steele City, Nebraska. As noted above,
the draft Supplemental EIS builds on and supplements the analysis
completed in August in 2011 by specifically addressing the new route
in Nebraska as well as any significant new information that has since
become available.
