**SUMMARY OF THE KEYSTONE XL PROJECT**

The proposed Keystone XL Project consists of a crude oil pipeline
and related facilities that would primarily be used to transport
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin crude oil from an oil supply hub
near Hardisty, Alberta, Canada to delivery points in Oklahoma and
Texas. The proposed Project would also be capable of transporting
U.S. crude oil to those delivery points. The U.S. portion of the
pipeline would begin near Morgan, Montana at the international border
of the United States and extend to delivery points in Nederland and
Moore Junction, Texas. There would also be a delivery point at Cushing,
Oklahoma. These three delivery points would provide access to many
other U.S. pipeline systems and terminals, including pipelines to
refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Market conditions, not the
operator of the pipeline, would determine the refining locations of
the crude oil.

The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would consist of approximately
1,711 miles of new 36-inch-diameter pipeline, with approximately 327
miles of pipeline in Canada and 1,384 miles in the U.S. Figure ES-3
depicts the three segments of the proposed Project in the U.S. As
noted in that illustration, the proposed Project would connect to
the northern and southern ends of the existing Cushing Extension of
the Keystone Oil Pipeline System.

Figure ES-4 illustrates the construction sequence that would be
followed for the proposed Project. The proposed Project would also
include 30 electrically operated pump stations, 112 mainline valves,
50 permanent access roads, and a new oil storage facility in Cushing,
Oklahoma. If market conditions change, the capacity of the proposed
Project could be increased to 830,000 bpd by increasing pumping
capacity at the proposed pump stations.

The overall proposed Keystone XL Project is estimated to cost $7
billion. If permitted, it would begin operation in 2013, with
the actual date dependant on the necessary permits, approvals,
and authorizations.

**Transport of Canadian Oil Sands Crude Oil**

The proposed Keystone XL Project would primarily transport crude
oil extracted from the oil sands areas in Alberta, Canada. Oil
sands (which are also referred to as tar sands) are a combination
of clay, sand, water, and bitumen, which is a material similar to
soft asphalt. Bitumen is extracted from the ground by mining or by
injecting steam underground to heat the bitumen to a point where it
liquefies and can be pumped to the surface.

Bitumen is treated in several ways to create crude oil suitable for
transport by pipeline and refining. The types of Canadian crude oil
that would be transported by the proposed Project would primarily
consist of synthetic crude oil and diluted bitumen.

Synthetic crude oil is produced from bitumen using refining methods --
a process termed upgrading -- that in general converts bitumen into
lighter liquid hydrocarbons. In other words, the bitumen is converted
into a crude oil similar to conventional crude oil.

Diluted bitumen -- often termed dilbit -- consists of bitumen
mixed with a diluent, which is a light hydrocarbon liquid such as
natural gas condensate or refinery naphtha. The bitumen is diluted to
reduce its viscosity so that it is in a more liquid form that can be
transported via pipeline. Dilbit is also processed to remove sand,
water, and other impurities. The diluents in dilbit are integrally
combined with the bitumen to form a crude oil that is a homogenous
mixture that does not physically separate when released.

Both synthetic crude oil and dilbit are similar in composition and
quality to the crude oils currently transported in pipelines in the
U.S. and being refined in Gulf Coast refineries. Neither type of
crude oil requires heating for transport in pipelines.
