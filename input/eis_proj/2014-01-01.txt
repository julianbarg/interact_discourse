**ES.2.2 Proposed Project Description**

The proposed Project would consist of approximately 875 miles of
new 36-inch-diameter pipeline and related facilities for transport
of WCSB and Bakken crude oil, the latter from an oil terminal near
Baker, Montana. Crude oil carried in the proposed Project would be
delivered to existing pipeline facilities near Steele City, Nebraska,
for onward delivery to refineries in the Gulf Coast area. The proposed
Project would also include two pump stations (one new and one expanded)
along the existing Keystone Pipeline in Kansas (see Figure ES-5).

Construction of the proposed Project would include the pipeline itself
plus various aboveground ancillary facilities (e.g., access roads,
pump stations, and construction camps) and connected actions. Figure
ES-4 illustrates the construction sequence that would be followed
for the proposed Project.

Construction of the proposed Project would generally require
a 110-foot-wide temporary ROW and is expected to last 1 to 2
years. After construction, the proposed Project would generally
maintain a 50-foot- wide permanent ROW easement over the pipeline in
Montana (approximately 285 miles), South Dakota (approximately 316
miles), and Nebraska (approximately 274 miles).

Keystone would have access to property within the easement, but
property owners would retain the ability to farm and conduct other
limited activities within the easement. The permanent aboveground
ancillary facilities would include electrically operated pump stations,
mainline valves, and permanent access roads.

**Figure ES-5 Proposed Project Overview**

The U.S. portion of the proposed Project is estimated to cost
approximately $3.3 billion, and would be paid for by Keystone. If
permitted, the pipeline would begin operation approximately 2 years
after final approvals were received, with the actual in-service date
dependent on construction as well as obtaining any additional permits,
approvals, and authorizations necessary before operations can commence.

**ES.2.2.1 The Bakken Marketlink Project**

Keystone Marketlink, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada
Pipelines Limited, would construct and operate the Bakken Marketlink
Project. This project would include a 5-mile pipeline, pumps,
meters, and storage tanks to supply Bakken crude oil to the proposed
pipeline from the Bakken Marketlink pipeline system in North Dakota
and Montana. Two crude oil storage tanks would be built near Baker,
Montana, as part of this project. This project would be able to deliver
up to 100,000 bpd of crude oil, and has commitments for approximately
65,000 bpd.

**ES.2.2.2 Big Bend to Witten 230-kV**

**Electrical Transmission Line**

The Western Area Power Administration (Western) has determined that
providing reliable electricity for operation of the proposed Project
requires the construction of a new 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission line
originating at the Fort Thompson/Big Bend Dam area in South Dakota
and extending south to the existing Witten Substation, near Pump
Stations 20 and 21. To meet these demands, Western would repurpose
existing transmission infrastructure and construct new infrastructure
between the Big Bend Dam and a proposed Big Bend Substation. The
Basin Electric Power Cooperative would construct a new 76-mile, 230-kV
transmission line from the Big Bend Substation to the existing Witten
Substation, and would operate both the transmission line and the Big
Bend Substation.

**ES.2.2.3 Electrical Distribution Lines and**

**Substations**

Electrical power for the proposed Project would be obtained from local
power providers. These power providers would construct the necessary
substations and transformers, and would either use existing service
lines or construct new service lines to deliver electrical power to
the specified point of use (e.g., pump stations and mainline valves),
which would be located at intervals along the proposed Project route.
