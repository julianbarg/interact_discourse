**Socioeconomics**

During construction, there would be temporary, positive socioeconomic
impacts as a result of local employment, taxes on worker income,
spending by construction workers, and spending on construction
goods and services. The construction work force would consist of
approximately 5,000 to 6,000 workers, including Keystone employees,
contractor employees, and construction and environmental inspection
staff. That would generate from $349 million to $419 in total wages. An
estimated $6.58 to $6.65 billion would be spent on materials and
supplies, easements, engineering, permitting, and other costs.

Adverse impacts during construction could include temporary
and minor increases in the need for public services, disruption
of local transportation corridors, and reduced availability of
transient housing. Keystone would establish four temporary work
camps in southeastern Montana and northwestern South Dakota to
minimize impacts to transient housing and public services in those
areas. Operation of the proposed Project would also result in long-term
to permanent beneficial socioeconomic impacts, including employment
and income benefits resulting from long-term hires and local operating
expenditures, and increased property tax revenues. An estimated $140.5
million in annual property tax revenues would be generated by the
proposed Project.
