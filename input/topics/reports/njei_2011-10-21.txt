## False Claims by "Friends of the Earth" About Keystone XL Pipeline and 91 Spills

October 21, 2011

On July 11, 2011, the activist organization Friends of the Earth
(FOE) released a document that was put together by Nebraska Professor
Stansbury who claimed, among other things, that TransCanada had
underestimated the frequency and volume of spills on its Keystone XL
pipeline. We welcome an open discussion on our pipeline; however, we
just wish activists would use the facts instead of dramatic rhetoric
and false claims.

We all owe Nebraskans an open and honest public discussion, so we
will use this opportunity to once again, set the record straight on
Keystone XL.

Whenever a so-called report or paper is published, it's important to
ask a few quick questions. First, was the document and claims being
made peer-reviewed? Does the person publishing the report attach their
professional credentials to the report to show that it has used valid
methodology and proven techniques? Is the person actually qualified
in the area they are commenting on?

In too many cases with the Keystone XL, it is professional activists
and lawyers who rush out with opinions that cannot be supported by
proven methodologies for risk assessment. All too often, groups driving
a fundraising campaign make outrageous claims based on citing quotes
in newspaper articles from other activist groups. In the Stansbury
Report released by FOE, there are 14 claims that are completely wrong.

The following information provides a technical response to errors
made by Professor Stansbury. For ease of reference, here is a list
of facts about Keystone XL:

1. Stansbury Report Mistake: "River crossings are especially
vulnerable," going on to describe "the pipeline is more susceptible
to corrosion because it is below ground and pressures are relatively
high."

The Facts: Keystone XL Pipeline is not vulnerable at river crossings;
the document referenced in report does not suggest it is.

2. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report incorrectly asserts that
TransCanada ignored 23% of statistical pipeline failures (pp. 1, 4).

The Facts: TransCanada's analysis accurately represents historical
data and does not overlook 23% of incidents as claimed.

3. Stansbury Report Mistake: TransCanada "arbitrarily assigned a
drain-down factor" for the pipeline.

The Facts: TransCanada estimates of volume released -- arbitrarily
adjusted in the Stansbury Report -- use results of a detailed study
prepared by the California Fire Marshal

4. Stansbury Report Mistake: TransCanada's adjustments to risk factors
are arbitrary and improper.

The Facts: TransCanada adjustments to risk factors are consistent
with industry experience.

5. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report erroneously relies on disproven
assumptions on corrosivity of oil to be shipped.

The Facts: Independent analysis of oil sands derived crude oils has
conclusively demonstrated that, below 450 degrees Fahrenheit, these
oils are not corrosive to steel.

6. Stansbury Report Mistake: The erroneously states that abrasive
sediment in the crude oil will cause higher failure rates.

The Facts: The oil that will be shipped on Keystone XL "shall have
no physical or chemical characteristics" that would damage or harm
the pipeline.

7. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report erroneously states bitumen
will sink, therefore "posing significant threat" to water resources.

The Facts: The gravity of crude oils that Keystone XL would transport
is less than the specific gravity of water.

8. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report suggests that TransCanada will
cut back on monitoring and maintenance activities, causing increased
risk in out years (p. 5).

The Facts: Contrary to a suggestion in the Stansbury Report, monitoring
and maintenance activities are a required condition of operation.

9. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report tries to suggest that because
shutdown on another pipeline took longer, that increased time should
be the new assumption on shutdown time (pp. 7-8).

The Facts: Keystone time to shutdown has been accurately reflected
in the risk analysis and is consistent with Keystone's record.

10.Stansbury Report Mistake: Report suggests that enough oil to fill
a dozen Olympic-sized swimming pools would go unnoticed in Nebraska
(pp. 8-9).

The Facts: The report's calculation of spill volume for "small" leak
not credible because it ignores leak detection methodologies designed
to detect low rate or seepage releases.

11. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report relies on old claims that
the emergency response plan for the Keystone pipeline is "woefully
inadequate."

The Facts: Contrary to assumptions in the Stansbury Report, the
Emergency Response capability for Keystone XL will meet or exceed
requirements.

12. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report includes exaggerated
descriptions of the physical extent of benzene.

The Facts: The exaggerated claims in the report do not match any
oil-spill experience; furthermore, benzene concentration in heavy oils
Keystone will ship will be comparable to other heavy oils shipped in
the U.S. and will generally be lower than benzene concentrations in
lighter crudes and in refined products such as gasoline.

13. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report claims TransCanada cut risk
factors in half.

The Facts: TransCanada reflected the results of industry studies
regarding failure rates of pipe-related equipment, reducing by half
the anticipated number of failures caused by material defect.

14. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report suggests that releases at
pump station sites means Keystone is using less reliable pipe.

The Facts: None of the pump stations releases involved pipeline.



The facts about Keystone XL don't change, despite the claims by those
who oppose the production, development and transportation of oil and
other petroleum products.

Let the facts keep guiding decisions and the conversation around
Keystone XL so that we can all have an honest, open and truly informed
discussion.

### Rebuttal to the Stansbury / Friends of the Earth Report

The Stansbury/Friends of the Earth Report (Stansbury Report) attempts
to build on a foundation of inaccurate assumptions that lead to greatly
exaggerated estimates of releases of oil and consequences. This is
simply the latest case of opportunistic fear-mongering, dressed up
as an academic study.

The Keystone Pipeline system is subject to comprehensive pipeline
safety regulation under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department
of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA). As the recent State Department Supplemental
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) recognizes, PHMSA is
responsible for protecting the American public and the environment
by ensuring the safe and secure movement of hazardous materials
to industry and consumers by all transportation modes, including
pipelines. To protect the public and environmental resources, Keystone
is required to construct, operate, maintain, inspect, and monitor the
pipeline in compliance with the PHMSA regulations at 49 CFR Part 195,
as well as relevant industry standards and codes. These regulations
specify pipeline material and qualification standards, minimum design
requirements, required measures to protect the pipeline from internal,
external corrosion, and many other aspects of safe operation.

Above and beyond the PHMSA regulations, Keystone has agreed to
comply with 57 additional Special Conditions developed by PHMSA
for the Keystone XL Project. Keystone has agreed to incorporate
these conditions into its design and construction, and its manual
for operations, maintenance, and emergencies required by 49 CFR
195.402. These 57 Special Conditions are attached as Appendix C to
the SDEIS.

PHMSA and the State Department took these 57 Special Conditions into
account in the SDEIS. It is significant to note the finding in the
SDEIS with respect to these conditions:

Incorporation of those conditions would result in a Project that
would have a degree of safety over any other typically constructed
domestic oil pipeline system under current code and a degree of safety
along the entire length of the pipeline system similar to that which
is required in High Consequence Areas (HCAs) as defined in 49 CFR
195.450. (SDEIS p. 2-9)

Based on an initial review, below are some of the major mistakes and
misrepresentations in the Stansbury Report.

1. Stansbury Report Mistake: "River crossings are especially
vulnerable," going on to describe "the pipeline is more susceptible
to corrosion because it is below ground and pressures are relatively
high."

The Facts: Keystone XL Pipeline is not vulnerable at river crossings;
document referenced in report does not suggest it is.

Background: The Summary report states (p. 2) that that "River
crossings are especially vulnerable," going on to describe that here
"the pipeline is more susceptible to corrosion because it is below
ground and pressures are relatively high."

In the corresponding section of Professor Stansbury's full report,
headed "Most Likely Spill Locations" (p. 6), the author states that
adjacent to rivers, "the pipeline is susceptible to high rates of
corrosion because it is below ground (DNV, 2006)." (Note that there is
no reference in this section of the report to the additional claim in
the Summary that at river crossings "pressures are relatively high.")

Nowhere in the 2006 DNV document cited is there any suggestion that
buried pipe at river crossings is more vulnerable to corrosion than
any other portion of the buried pipeline. Nor is there any support
for the statement in the summary about relative operating pressure
at river crossings increasing susceptibility to corrosion.

The only statement in the DNV report remotely related to this
unfounded assertion is this: "The Keystone Pipeline is being designed
to consist entirely of below ground pipe except within Pump Station
fence lines. Sections of the pipeline below ground were considered
to be more likely to incur corrosion than above ground sections."

Further, the statement in the DNV report was made within a section
that highlights special measures Keystone will employ to eliminate
risk of external corrosion. Keystone employs an approach to corrosion
protection that has virtually eliminated failure due to external
corrosion in the 30-plus years it has been in use. It includes fusion
bond epoxy coating (FBE) coupled with active cathodic protection,
which places a small current on the pipe preventing loss of metal
due to corrosion. Keystone also will be inspected more frequently
than standard regulations require, ensuring the effectiveness of
this system.

Relative to other failure modes at river crossings, such as flooding or
increased river flows scouring the river bottom or banks and exposing
the pipe and making it vulnerable to damage or breakage, Keystone will
utilize the horizontal directional drill (HDD) crossing method that
places the pipe 25 feet or more below the river bottom at locations
where scour is considered a potential threat. Other measures at river
crossings further reduce the likelihood of failure. For instance,
each of the river crossings mentioned in the report (Yellowstone,
Missouri, Platte) will be installed using the HDD method and will
utilize heavy-walled pipe with sacrificial abrasion-resistant coating
applied over the FBE to further ensure the protective capability
of the coating. These measures make these locations among the least
likely for a release on the entire pipeline.

2. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report incorrectly asserts that
TransCanada ignored 23% of statistical pipeline failures (pp. 1, 4).

The Facts: TransCanada's analysis accurately represents historical
data and does not overlook 23% of incidents as claimed

Background: The report incorrectly asserts that TransCanada ignored
23% of statistical pipeline failures (pp. 1, 4). In part because the
PHMSA data does not identify the cause for 23% of pipeline incidents,
TransCanada used a more detailed assessment of causes of historical
pipeline incidents, evaluating Keystone against each of these threats
to establish an accurate risk profile. The applicable threats to
the pipeline were determined using established pipeline industry
standards ASME B31.8S and API 1160. This fact was noted within the
DNV report itself:

"It should be noted that the factors are similar but not identical
to the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety
(OPS) categories of failure (e.g., third party harm)." (DNV 2006, p. 3)

3. Stansbury Report Mistake: TransCanada "arbitrarily assigned a
drain-down factor" for the pipeline

The Facts: TransCanada estimates of volume released -- arbitrarily
adjusted in the Stansbury Report -- use results of a detailed study
prepared by the California Fire Marshal

In calculating how much oil might be released from a pipeline after it
is secured and isolated, the author claims TransCanada "arbitrarily
assigned a drain-down factor" for the pipeline (p. 9). Not noted,
however, is that TransCanada's methodology reflects not TransCanada's
judgment but rather the results of an independent assessment by the
California Fire Marshal in its role as a regulator in California. The
report is well known and respected among pipeline regulators and risk
assessors. After labeling use of the California Fire Marshal figure
for retained volume "arbitrary," it is ironic that the author goes
on to say the factor "is likely too high" and cuts it in half with
no further justification.

4. Stansbury Report Mistake: TransCanada's adjustment to risk factors
are arbitrary and improper

The Facts: TransCanada adjustments to risk factors are consistent
with industry experience

Background: The Summary report states that "TransCanada arbitrarily and
improperly adjusted spill factors" (p. 1). The full report written by
Professor Stansbury is less strident, suggesting the adjustments are
"probably not appropriate" (p. 4).

The majority of pipeline infrastructure in North America was
constructed many decades ago at a time when the materials, coating
systems, and ongoing inspection capabilities that will be used
for Keystone XL were not available. Studies show the benefits of
these technologies in reducing pipeline incidents. For instance
(as described in para. #1 above), the corrosion protection Keystone
uses has virtually eliminated external corrosion as a cause of
failure. Approximately two thirds of the pipelines in the US were
constructed prior to 1970. It is therefore entirely appropriate to use
an incident frequency for Keystone XL that is derived from pipelines
of its class. To do otherwise would be like trying to estimate the
gas mileage of a 2011 model car by using the average gas mileage of
all cars built since the 1920s.

This is corroborated by observations included in the SDEIS, including:

"It is likely that both incident frequency analyses tend to
overestimate the likely spill frequency of the proposed Project
since both analyses rely on data that include incidents on older
pipelines that would not be operated under the Project-specific
Special Conditions developed by PHMSA and incorporated into the
design, construction, operations, and maintenance plans for the
proposed Project." (SDEIS, p. 3-98)

Examples of measures taken by TransCanada to reduce risk on Keystone
include:

    External corrosion - Keystone employs an approach to corrosion
    protection that has virtually eliminated failure due to external
    corrosion in the 30-plus years it has been in use. It includes
    fusion bond epoxy coating and active cathodic protection, which
    places a small current on the pipe preventing loss of metal
    due to corrosion. Keystone has agreed to a special regulatory
    condition requiring the pipeline to be internally inspected
    with an instrumented device that monitors the pipe wall for
    anomalies. Any wall degradation due to corrosion would be detected
    and addressed prior to failure. (These requirements are covered
    by several PHMSA Special Conditions, including #9, 10, 11, 33,
    35-39, 42, 53.)  External impact - Keystone will be buried at a
    deeper depth to minimize risk of external impact. In addition,
    pipe walls will exhibit greater puncture resistance and fracture
    control properties. Keystone will take additional steps to minimize
    risk of accidental excavation damage. (Required by PHMSA Special
    Conditions #7, 19, 40, 41, 48, 53, 54).  Internal corrosion - Limit
    sediment and water content of oil shipped to 0.5%. Run cleaning
    tools twice per year in the first year and as necessary based on
    integrity analysis. Implement a crude oil monitoring and sampling
    program to ensure products transported meet specifications. Perform
    internal inspections at increased frequency. (Required by PHMSA
    Special Conditions #33, 34, 42, 53) Mechanical defect - enhanced
    material requirements and QA/QC program as described in PHMSA
    Special Conditions #1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 22.

5. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report erroneously relies on disproven
assumptions on corrosivity of oil to be shipped.

The Facts: Independent analysis of oil sands derived crude oils has
conclusively demonstrated that, below 450 degrees Fahrenheit, these
oils are not corrosive to steel.

Background: The Stansbury Report states Keystone is subject to
higher failure rates due to corrosivity of oil to be shipped
(p. 5). Independent analysis of oil sands derived crude oils has
conclusively demonstrated that, below 450 degrees Fahrenheit, these
oils are not corrosive to steel. The maximum operating temperature
anywhere in the pipeline is 150 degrees. (Supplemental Draft EIS,
Keystone XL, p. 3‐112.) A recent independent assessment of crude
oil quality by the firm Crude Quality Inc., including corrosion
potential, has been completed and provided to the U.S. Department of
State supporting these findings.

Keystone XL will ship a wide variety of crude oil types including
conventional oil, shale oil, partially upgraded synthetic oil and oil
sands derived bitumen blends. None of these crude types create a risk
of destroying the pipeline from within and causing leaks. Furthermore
these products have shipped and are currently being shipped across
to the US via other cross-border pipelines from Canada. It would
be an uneconomic business proposition to spend $13 billion dollars
constructing a pipeline system that would be destroyed by the product
it transported.

6. Stansbury Report Mistake: The erroneously states that abrasive
sediment in the crude oil will cause higher failure rates

The Facts: The oil that will be shipped on Keystone XL "shall have
no physical or chemical characteristics" that would damage or harm
the pipeline.

Background: Report states Keystone is subject to higher failure rates
due to abrasive sediment (p. 5). However, as clarified in the SDEIS,
oil transported by Keystone must meet strict limits for sediment and
water. (SDEIS, p. 3-116).

Special Condition 34 (see Appendix C of this SDEIS) addresses the
sediment and water content of the crude oil that would be transported
by the proposed Project and states the following:

"Internal Corrosion: Keystone shall limit basic sediment and water
(BS&W) to 0.5% by volume and report BS&W testing results to PHMSA in
the annual report."

The FERC-approved tariff for transport of oil on the Keystone Pipeline
system also requires that all oil to be shipped:

"shall have no physical or chemical characteristics that may
render such Petroleum not readily transportable by Carrier or that
may materially affect the quality of other Petroleum transported by
Carrier or that may otherwise cause disadvantage or harm to Carrier
or the Pipeline System, or otherwise impair Carrier's ability to
provide service on the Pipeline System." (SDEIS, Pp. 3-116).

7. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report erroneously states bitumen
will sink, therefore "posing significant threat" to water resources.

The Facts: The gravity of crude oils that Keystone XL would transport
are less than the specific gravity of water.

Background: The report states bitumen will sink "posing significant
threat" (p. 19). This issue was addressed in the SDEIS, which includes
the following summary statement: "the specific gravity of the crude
oils that would be transported on the proposed pipeline ranges
from about 0.85 to about 0.93, less than the specific gravity of
water. These crude oils, therefore, tend to float on water..." (SDEIS,
p. 3-104)

8. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report suggests that TransCanada will
cut back on monitoring and maintenance activities, causing increased
risk in out years (p. 5).

The Facts: Contrary to a suggestion in the Stansbury Report, monitoring
and maintenance activities are a required condition of operation.

Background: The report suggests that TransCanada will cut back on
monitoring and maintenance activities, causing increased risk in
out years (p. 5). However, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations
requires many of these monitoring and maintenance activities as
a condition of operation. TransCanada has voluntarily committed
to 57 additional safety conditions that include other enhanced
monitoring and maintenance activities as additional conditions of
continued operation. For instance, in order to continue to operate the
pipeline, TransCanada must perform in-line inspection with a smart pig,
conduct corrosion surveys, and perform valve inspections at specified
frequencies -- these are not discretionary. Additionally, TransCanada
must meet requirements to patrol the pipeline every two weeks.

In addition to regulatory requirements, continuing to invest in the
safety of the pipeline makes sense from a business perspective. Paying
for increased maintenance is built into TransCanada's contracts
with its shippers such that variable integrity spending costs are
flowed through to the shippers. Additionally, the FERC rate allows the
uncommitted toll to rise at a greater than inflation rate which allows
for recovery of maintenance costs. There is therefore no financial
incentive for TransCanada to cut back on monitoring and maintenance
and a substantial financial penalty associated with leaks in the
form of fines, cleanup costs, lawsuits and reputational damage. It
is therefore not reasonable to suggest that TransCanada or another
owner would increase their liability in order to reduce an expense
that is flowed through to the customers.

9. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report tries to suggest that because
shutdown on another pipeline took longer, that increased time should
be the new assumption on shutdown time (pp. 7-8).

The Facts: Keystone time to shutdown has been accurately reflected
in the risk analysis and is consistent with Keystone's record.

Background: The Stansbury Report tries to suggest that because shutdown
on another pipeline took longer, that increased time should be the new
assumption on shutdown time (pp. 7-8). However, the author does not
address the differences in system design and operating characteristics
(including single phase flow in Keystone) that make it unlikely that
Keystone operators would experience difficulty detecting a leak. Nor
does he address industry information sharing or the workings of
the regulatory regime, both of which serve to make it unlikely that
operational errors are repeated.

Additionally, Keystone has established its own operating record that
demonstrates prompt reaction time to any indication of an operational
abnormality. These response records align with the shut down times
conveyed in Keystone's risk assessment report.

10. Stansbury Report Mistake: Report suggests that enough oil to fill
a dozen Olympic- sized swimming pools would go unnoticed in Nebraska
(pp. 8-9).

The Facts: The report's calculation of spill volume for "small" leak
not credible because it ignores leak detection methodologies designed
to detect low rate or seepage releases.

Background: In assessing worst-case "small" leak, the Stansbury
Report suggests that enough oil to fill a dozen Olympic-sized swimming
pools would go unnoticed in Nebraska (pp. 8-9). The estimate ignores
leak detection methodologies designed to detect low rate or seepage
releases.

As described below, Keystone will utilize a state-of-the-art integrated
leak detection system. Real-time computerized systems can detect spills
as low as 1.5 percent of throughput. In addition to surveillance and
public reporting, Keystone will implement a non-real time mass balance
procedure that can detect spills below 1.5 percent of throughput.

Data from actual pipeline spills demonstrate that substantial leaks do
not go undetected for long periods of time. Further, those spills that
are not detected within the first 48 hours are typically relatively
small. PHMSA records (2001 through 2009) indicate that the majority of
spills are 3 barrels or less, regardless of detection time. These data
also indicate that the majority of spills are detected within 2 hours,
with 99 percent of spills detected within 7 days. Of those spills not
detected within the first 48 hours, the majority of spills were 15
barrels or less. In summary, large spills do not remain undetected
for substantial periods of time.

The pipeline will be monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from
the Operations Control Center (OCC) using a sophisticated Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Keystone will utilize
multiple leak detection methods and systems that are overlapping in
nature and progress through a series of leak detection thresholds. The
leak detection methods are as follows:

    Remote monitoring performed by the OCC Operator 24/7, which
    consists of monitoring pressure and flow data received from pump
    stations and valve sites fed back to the OCC by the Keystone SCADA
    system. Remote monitoring is typically able to detect leaks down
    to approximately 25 to 30 percent of the pipeline flow rate.
    Software-based volume balance systems that monitor receipt and
    delivery volumes. These systems are typically able to detect
    leaks down to approximately 5 percent of the pipeline flow rate.
    Computational Pipeline Monitoring or model-based leak detection
    systems that break the pipeline into smaller segments and
    monitor each of these segments on a mass balance basis. These
    systems are typically capable of detecting leaks down to a
    level of approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of pipeline flow rate.
    Computer-based, non-real time accumulated gain/(loss) volume
    trending to assist in identifying low rate or seepage releases
    below the 1.5 to 2 percent by volume detection thresholds.  Direct
    observation methods, which include aerial patrols, ground patrols,
    and public and landowner awareness programs that are designed
    to encourage and facilitate the reporting of suspected leaks and
    events that may suggest a threat to the integrity of the pipeline.

The leak detection system will be configured in a manner capable of
sending an alarm to the OCC operators through the SCADA system and
also will provide the OCC operators with a comprehensive assortment
of display screens for incident analysis and investigation. In
addition, there will be a redundant, stand-by OCC to be used in case
of emergency.

Keystone also will have an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to
respond to incidents. The ERP contains comprehensive manuals, detailed
training plans, equipment requirements, resources plans, auditing,
change management and continuous improvement processes. The Integrity
Management Program (IMP) (49 CFR Part 195) and ERP will ensure Keystone
will operate the pipeline in an environmentally responsible manner.

11. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report relies on old claims that
the emergency response plan for the Keystone pipeline is "woefully
inadequate"

The Facts: Contrary to assumptions in the Stansbury Report, the
Emergency Response capability for Keystone XL will meet or exceed
requirements.

Background: The Stansbury Report relies on old claims that the
emergency response plan for the Keystone pipeline is "woefully
inadequate" (p. 3). This accusation was one of the items reviewed in
detail in the SDEIS.

"DOS and PHMSA have reviewed these hypothetical spill response
scenarios prepared by Keystone and would also review a final ERP to be
prepared by Keystone prior to startup of the proposed pipeline...Based
on its review of the hypothetical spill response scenarios, DOS
considers Keystone's response planning appropriate and consistent
with accepted industry practice." (SDEIS, p. 3-122)

12. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report includes exaggerated
descriptions of the physical extent of benzene.

The Facts: The exaggerated claims in the report do not match any
oil-spill experience; furthermore, benzene concentration in heavy oils
Keystone will ship will be comparable to other heavy oils shipped in
the U.S. and will generally be lower than benzene concentrations in
lighter crudes and in refined products such as gasoline.

Background: Benzene concentration in heavy oils Keystone will ship
will be comparable to other heavy oils shipped in the U.S. and will
generally be lower than benzene concentrations in lighter crudes and
in refined products such as gasoline.

Exaggerated descriptions of the physical extent of benzene in the
Stansbury Report do not match any oil-spill experience. The report does
not account for emergency response containment and cleanup. Examination
of field data collected from large spills into rivers typically finds
that concentrations of petroleum products become undetectable in a
relatively short distance. For example, following a 10,000 barrel
release in 2007 from the Coffeeville Refinery in Kansas into the
Verdigris River, the EPA found no detectable concentrations of
petroleum products 20 miles downstream at the closest municipal
water intake.

13. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report claims TransCanada cut risk
factors in half.

The Facts: TransCanada reflected the results of industry studies
regarding failure rates of pipe-related equipment, reducing by half
the anticipated number of failures caused by material defect.

Background: TransCanada assumed that its pipeline would be constructed
so well that it would have only half as many spills as the other
pipelines in service. Not true. Rather, TransCanada reflected the
results of industry studies regarding failure rates of pipe-related
equipment, reducing by half the anticipated number of failures caused
by material defect. As discussed in item #4 above, measures that help
achieve this performance are among the Special Conditions to which
TransCanada has committed.

Here is the statement from the TransCanada report: "A 50% reduction in
the DOT leak frequency was applied to the entire pipeline because the
U.S. portion of Keystone will consist of entirely new materials and be
constructed to meet current standards and requirements." [DNV section
4.1.13, page 13] The statement occurs in a section of the DNV report
describing risk of mechanical defect. Other risk factors are adjusted
differently for above-ground and below-ground pipe for instance.

14. Stansbury Report Mistake: The report suggests that releases at
pump station sites means Keystone is using less reliable pipe.

The Facts: None of the pump stations releases involved pipeline.

Background: As of June 1, 2011 the Keystone pipeline has experienced
fourteen (14) unplanned releases within pump/valve station facility
sites, averaging 5-10 barrels each. None of these incidents have
involved the pipeline itself. In two cases, nearby adjacent property
was affected by spray. Otherwise, the incidents were contained within
our pump station facility. Equipment has been replaced or repaired. In
all cases, Keystone's operation personnel immediately isolate all
releases and clean up and remediation efforts are employed to mitigate
any effects to the environment.

TransCanada meets or exceeds all notification and reporting
requirements to all state and federal agencies. In many of these cases,
reporting to regulatory agencies was not required due to the very small
volume of these spills. TransCanada has taken a transparent approach to
proactively report all spills to federal and state regulatory agencies
regardless of volume. Pipelines are the safest method of transporting
the oil that must be moved throughout North America everyday.
