**Analysis of Worst-Case Spills From the Proposed Keystone XL
Pipeline**

**John Stansbury, Ph.D., P.E. 1**

**Summary of Key Findings**

A major spill from the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline on
the Platte River in Nebraska could spill 5.9 million gallons of
toxic, corrosive tar sands oil and spread pollutants such as car-
cinogenic benzene in excess of federal health standards hundreds
of miles downstream, contami- nating drinking water for hundreds of
thousands of people as far south as Kansas City, Mo. Even a small,
undetected leak from an underground rupture of the pipeline in
the Nebraska Sandhills could pollute almost 5 billion gallons of
groundwater with benzene at concentrations exceeding safe drinking
water levels -- enough water to form a plume 15 miles long, posing
serious health threats to anyone using the underlying Ogallala
Aquifer for drinking water or agriculture. And a worst-case spill
at the pipeline's crossing of the Missouri or Yellowstone Rivers in
Montana could spill well over 5 million gallons of tar sands oil,
contaminating drinking and recreational water in North Dakota with
harmful levels of benzene and other chemicals.

An independent analysis of worst-case spill scenarios for four
locations along the proposed Keystone XL pipeline route through
Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas found that
the pipeline's operator, TransCanada Corp., made significant flawed
and inap- propriate assumptions about the frequency and severity of
expected spills from its pipelines.

Although the federal Clean Water Act requires pipeline builders to
analyze and make public worst-case spill scenarios and resulting
environmental impacts for their projects before beginning operation,
TransCanada has yet to adequately do so for the Keystone XL,
and the pipeline could be approved before regulators see the
conclusions. However, in comparison to the methods the company used to
calculate worst-case scenarios for the existing Keystone I pipeline,
to which the XL would connect, this independent analysis found:

• While TransCanada estimates that the Keystone XL will have
11 significant spills (more than 50 barrels of crude oil) over 50
years, a more realistic assessment is 91 significant spills over the
pipeline's operational lifetime.

• TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to
produce an estimate of one major spill on the 1,673 miles of pipeline
about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of
spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost
two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had
one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)

• Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that
response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take
more than ten times longer than the 11 min- utes and 30 seconds
that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than
800,000 gallons of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River,
an Enbridge tar

sands pipeline -- a 30 inch pipe compared to the 36-inch Keystone XL --
was not complete- ly shut down for 12 hours.)

• Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more
than 180,000 barrels (about 7.9 million gallons) in the Nebraska
Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than 160,000 barrels
(about 6.9 million gallons) of crude oil at the Yellowstone River
cross- ings, more than 140,000 barrels (about 5.9 million gallons)
at the Platte River crossing and more than 120,000 barrels (about
5.2 million gallons) at the Missouri River crossing.

**Key Chemicals in a Keystone XL Pipeline Spill**

Chemical Impacts Benzene Benzene poses threats as an airborne and
water-

borne pollutant. It can form gaseous clouds around a spill site and
dissolve into a toxic plume that extends downstream. Health impacts
(according to the EPA): Anemia; decrease in blood platelets; increased
risk of can- cer.

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (e.g., benz(a)pyrene)

Most PAHs will remain close to the site of a spill, forming a toxic
plume. PAHs are a particular threat to aquatic life. Health impacts
(according to the EPA): Reproduc- tive difficulties; increased risk
of cancer.

Hydrogen Sulfide Hydrogen sulfide is very volatile, meaning that it
will vaporize quickly. Most impacts, which in- clude acute toxicity
via inhalation and toxic effects to aquatic life, will be close to
the spill site.

Bitumen (raw tar sands oil) Bitumen is denser than water and will
sink to the riverbed, smothering aquatic animals and plants close to
the spill site and making clean up difficult. These impacts are of
particular concern in the habitats of endangered species.

**Worst-case Scenarios**

Although a major spill could occur on any part of the pipeline, the
most likely failure points are welds, valve connections and pumping
stations. River crossings are especially vulnerable because the
pipeline, which must include valves on either side of the river, is
underground but relatively shallow. At river crossings the pipeline is
more susceptible to corrosion because it is below ground and pressures
are relatively high. Small initial leaks from corroded pipe, accord-
ing to estimates made by TransCanada, could go undetected for up to
90 days, a prescription for catastrophic failure during a pressure
spike. Areas with shallow groundwater overlain by perme- able soils
(such as the Ogallala Aquifer in the Sandhills), where, according to
estimates made by TransCanada, slow leaks could go undetected for up
to 90 days, also pose risks of special con- cern.

**Missouri River, Mont.**

The Keystone XL would cross the Missouri River just downstream of Fort
Peck Dam in northern Montana. The worst-case scenario would be for the
upstream pipeline valve, closest to the river, to fail. An estimated
75,000 barrels of crude oil would be released from the leak in the two
hours assumed for the response time. In addition, 47,867 barrels would
drain from the pipeline from elevations above the rupture resulting
in a total worst-case release of 122,867 barrels (5.2 million gallons).

Benzene and other contaminants from a worst-case spill at the
Missouri River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota
where they would adversely affect drinking water, aquatic wildlife,
and recreation. A spill would pose a significant threat to a number of
threatened or endangered species in the river and lake. Concentrations
of benzene and hydrogen sulfide in the air near the spill site could
also be a serious health threat to emergency workers, remediation
workers and local residents.

**Yellowstone River, Mont.**

The pipeline would cross the Yellowstone River approximately 20 miles
upstream of Glendive in eastern Montana. This crossing is between two
high points 17 miles apart. The worst-case scenario would be failure
of the valve two miles upstream from the crossing, which could release
90,416 barrels of crude oil in the pipe between the elevations. Adding
75,000 barrels for the two- hour response time, the worst-case spill
would be 165,416 barrels, or almost 6.9 million gallons.

Benzene and other contaminants from a worst-case spill at the
Yellowstone River crossing, as at the Missouri river crossing, would
enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would

Heavy crude smothers plants and animals on land and in the river.

Benzene, hydrogen sulde and oil evaporate into the air, causing
a toxic cloud above the river that can drift and contaminate
surrounding human and animal habitats, and can be dangerous for clean
up workers. Hydrogen sulde, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
and crude oil dissolve in the water, potentially contaminating drinking
water, harming aquatic species and creating a toxic benzene plume
that could reach hundreds of miles downstream.

Possible e?ects of a worst-case spill near a river.

adversely affect drinking water, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. A
spill would pose a significant threat to a number of threatened or
endangered species in the river and lake. Airborne concen- trations
of benzene and hydrogen sulfide at the spill site could also be a
serious health threat to emergency workers, remediation workers and
local residents.

**Platte River, Neb.**

The pipeline would cross the Platte River approximately three
miles downstream of Central City, Nebraska. If the valve 8.5 miles
downstream failed, 65,950 barrels of crude oil could be released
between the nearest high point and the closest upstream valve. With
the additional oil pumped during the response time, the worst-case
spill could total 140,950 barrels, or more than 5.9 mil- lion gallons.

A spill of this magnitude at this location could create a plume of
water contaminated with ben- zene at a level over 10 times higher than
the EPA's Maximum Contamination Level (MCL) for drinking water. The
benzene concentration would decrease as the plume spread, but it
would have to travel hundreds of miles downstream before the level
dropped below the MCL and be- came safe to drink. The plume could
flow down the Platte River into the Missouri River, threat- ening
drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people in cities
including Lincoln, Omaha and Nebraska City, Neb., and St. Joseph and
Kansas City, Mo. Other constituents from the spill would pose serious
health risks to aquatic species in the river.

A spill at either crossing could release millions of gallons of crude
oil into the rivers and extending downstream as far as Lake Sakakawea,
polluting drinking water, and threatening endangered species and
recreation areas.

**Sandhills, Neb.**

The worst-case spill from a small leak, as opposed to a valve failure,
would be a remote location where the pipeline is buried above a source
of groundwater and where direct observation is in- frequent, such
as the Sandhills. TransCanada acknowledges that a slow leak could go
undetected for up to 90 days, but a reasonable assumption is that a
leak would be detected within 14 days, the interval between aircraft
inspections. Such a spill across 14 days would result in a release
of 189,000 barrels of crude oil, or 7.9 million gallons.

The benzene released by the worst-case spill to groundwater in the
Sandhills would be enough to contaminate 4.9 billion gallons of water
at concentrations exceeding the MCL. This water could form a plume 40
feet thick by 500 feet wide by 15 miles long. This plume would pose
serious health risks to people using that groundwater for drinking
water and irrigation.

**TransCanada's Flawed Assumptions**

According to TransCanada, significant spills (more than 50 barrels)
are expected to be very rare (0.00013 spills/year/mile, or 11 major
spills over a 50-year design life). However, TransCanada made several
highly questionable assumptions, including:

• TransCanada ignored historical data on almost one-fourth of
pipeline spills by excluding all spills for which the cause is
not known.

• TransCanada assumed, without supporting data, that Keystone XL will
be constructed so well that it will have only half as many spills as
existing pipelines, even though the tar sands crude to be transported
through the pipeline is more likely to leak than the conven- tional
crude in other pipelines.

Therefore, a more realistic assessment of expected frequency of
significant spills, based on his- torical data, is 0.00109 spills
per year per mile, resulting in 91 significant spills over a 50-year
design life of the pipeline (including more than 12 spills from holes
greater than 10 inches).

TransCanada consistently states the frequency of spills in terms of
spills per year per mile. This is misleading; a more appropriate way
to state the frequency would be the frequency of a spill somewhere
along the length of the pipeline. Stating the spill frequency in terms
of spills per mile is comparable to acknowledging that, although some

Worst-case spill above the Nebraska Sandhills.

A spill over 14 days, releasing 7.9 million gallons of crude oil
could contaminate 4.9 billion gallons of water and form a plume 40
feet thick by 500 feet wide by 15 miles long. By comparison:

The length of the plume is equal to 264 football Šelds. Manhattan

is equal to that of 19,631 Olympic sized pools.

occur annually in the U.S., the average annual fatality rate across
350 million people is only 0.000094; therefore, fatalities from
automobile accidents are so rare as to be unimportant.

TransCanada's other major flawed assumption -- again, unsupported by
any data -- is that in case of an accident, the Keystone XL can be
shut down in 11.5 minutes. This is wildly optimistic. In the June
2010 spill on the very similar Enbridge pipeline in Michigan, the
time to finally shut down the pipeline was approximately 12 hours, and
during that time the pumps operated for at least two hours. Therefore,
a more realistic estimate of shutdown time is two hours. When ap-
plied to a hypothetical spill at the Keystone's pumping station in
Hardisty, Alberta, the difference between TransCanada's assumptions
and the appropriate values is a spill of 41,504 barrels vs. one of
87,964 barrels.
