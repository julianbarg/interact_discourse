The oil industry is currently planning a massive project to export
millions of barrels more per day of dirty tar sands oil from Alberta,
Canada to the United States. Tar sands strip-mining and drilling in

Canada's Boreal forest is the largest and most destructive project
on Earth. The decline in oil demand and the rise of alternative
energy puts North America on the verge of a phenomenally important
step forward toward a new, clean energy economy. Expanding reliance
on tar sands is unnecessary, undermines our progress as a nation,
and is severely destructive. We have a choice: we can move forward
towards a clean energy future with greater national security or remain
stuck with the dirty fossil fuels of the past.

**Tar Sands are Dirty and Expensive**

Canadian tar sands deposits are found primarily under Alberta's Boreal
forest and wetlands in an area about the size of Florida.1 In order
to access them, millions of acres of pristine forest and wildlife
habitat have to be strip-mined and drilled, destroying these areas
and severely disrupting critical terrestrial carbon reservoirs in the
peatlands of the Boreal forest. Because it requires large amounts of
energy, production of synthetic crude oil from tar sands is estimated
to release at least three times the greenhouse gas emissions per
barrel as compared to production of conventional crude oil.2 In
addition to its high carbon pollution costs, tar sands oil production
requires two to five barrels of water for each barrel of tar sands
extracted,3 has already created over 50 square miles of toxic waste
ponds,4 threatens the health of downstream indigenous communities,5
and is likely to cause the loss of millions of migratory birds that
nest in the forests and wetlands of the region.6

*" Our dependence on oil---not just foreign oil---reduces our leverage
internationally and limits our options. I say all oil, because we
simply do not have enough resources in this country to free us from
the stranglehold of those who do."*

**Tar Sands Oil Brings Severe Negative Impacts to America**

the united states is the main consumer of dirty tar sands oil. sixty
percent of the 1.34 million barrels of tar sands oil produced daily
in Canada are exported to the united states, and oil companies are
aiming to expand this production to as much as 3.5 million barrels
per day (mbd) by 2025.7 In America, oil and pipeline companies plan
to build an extensive tar sands pipeline and refinery infrastructure
that will continue u.s. dependence on this high-carbon fossil
fuel for many decades to come. tar sands infrastructure investment
conflicts with American goals of stopping climate change and shifting
the u.s. transportation sector to cleaner alternatives. Pipelines
also bring a serious danger of oil spills to America's agricultural
heartland. the proposed Keystone Xl tar sands pipeline could become a
nearly 2,000 mile-long boondoggle that is never filled. Pollution from
refineries threatens local communities and the Great lakes. upgrading
tar sands that contain sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, lead and arsenic
can lead to pollutants that cause acid rain and a host of health
problems, including asthma and bronchitis. All of these environmental
and health consequences are unnecessary because, due to declining
demand and improving fuel efficiency, the united states does not need
tar sands oil.

America's New Energy Economy

**Clean Energy Saves Oil**

In 10 years, the U.S. can save more oil (4.2 mbd) than we import from
the Middle East and Venezuela (3.6 mbd).

In 20 years, the U.S. can save more oil (10 mbd) than we import from
the Middle East, Venezuela and the Canadian tar sands combined.

This can be accomplished using technology available today, and will
improve air quality, reduce global warming pollution, and create jobs.

**American Security Depends on Reducing Dependence on Oil**

the best security policy for our nation and climate is to
aggressively implement fuel efficiency and other measures that
reduce oil dependency. these and other measures stand to reduce
u.s. demand for oil by four million barrels per day by 2020 and ten
million barrels per day by 2030, which would make expansion of tar
sands unnecessary for u.s. fuel needs.8 Given the climate change
risks associated with development of the tar sands and other high-
carbon fuels, the best security policy for America is to invest in
cleaner, low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels. major oil company
and other tar sands oil interests are attacking climate and clean
energy policies in the united states and elsewhere. Concerned about
their massive investments, tar sands oil interests are trying to
undermine fuel standards, fuel purchasing provisions and other clean
energy initiatives that would protect our climate, create green
jobs and secure our future. expansion of tar sands will undermine
a u.s. transition to a clean energy economy. Further, tar sands oil
cannot enhance energy security in the united states because it is too
expensive and there is not enough of it. Producing tar sands oil will
not break the power of oPeC, which controls the world oil market. tar
sands cannot compete in a world of low oil prices; in fact, oil from
tar sands is among the most expensive anywhere. tar sands would not
help in the event of an embargo or natural disaster that disrupts
supply, because the tar sands industry carries no spare capacity.

**Solutions for Stopping the Tar Sands Invasion**

there are serious consequences and costs to the united states in
encouraging tar sands oil expansion. Fortunately, there are solutions
that policy-makers and business leaders can put in place now.

n stop expansion of tar sands oil production in Canada.

n Build no more tar sands pipelines and refineries in the united
states.

n Continue to reduce demand for oil as a transportation fuel.

n don't spend taxpayer dollars on buying tar sands oil.

n eliminate tar sands oil subsidies and financing.

n Adopt corporate policies that do not support tar sands oil.

**A Better Way Forward**

As the world's largest oil consumer, the united states has choices
about its energy future. America currently consumes a quarter of
the world's oil supply. we must and can do better, and we have the
technology to do it. A nation as innovative and motivated as the
united states can find a way to maintain mobility, while at the
same time acting to halt expansion of expensive and dirty fuels
such as tar sands oil that cause global warming and a host of other
environmental and health problems. electric cars, renewable energy,
environmentally sustainable biofuels, fuel efficiency, and smart
growth are all positive solutions to meet our future energy needs.
