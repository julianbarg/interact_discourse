**TO: Editorial Writers, Columnists and Reporters covering the Gulf
Oil Spill and energy policy FROM: Alex Moore DATE: May 26, 2010 RE:
Why oil from Canada's tar sands is another false solution to our
nation's energy needs**

As oil continues to gush into the Gulf of Mexico from the site of
the exploded BP drilling rig, public support for more drilling is
sinking and politicians are looking for alternatives to offshore oil.

This memo and the fact sheets that follow it are designed to provide
you with the resources to cover one dangerous energy alternative that
oil industry giants like BP are promoting: Canada's tar sands.

Tar sands oil, the world's dirtiest, is already on track to surpass
conventional crude as our nation's top source of imported oil. A
report released May 17 by the sustainable investment network Ceres
warns that the tar sands industry bears environmental and financial
risks that eclipse even those of Gulf drilling.

Now oil and gas company TransCanada is seeking a permit from the
Obama administration to build a new pipeline through the U.S. that
would double our dependence on this dirty and costly oil. A public
comment period on the State Department's draft analysis of the
pipeline's potential environmental impacts closes June 16. Then this
fall President Obama will face a final decision: approve this project
or steer our country toward cleaner, safer energy choices.

These resources will help you generate insightful coverage of the
stakes of the Obama administration's decision -- for our energy future,
climate stability and public health.

Factsheets and resources on the following topics are included:

• BP's expanding investments in tar sands oil

• An overview of the Keystone XL pipeline project

• The pipeline's potential impacts on natural resources and public
health

• Tar sands oil's climate and health impacts

• An interview with Mike Mercredi on how the tar sands industry is
impacting his community

**Our Energy Future: From Offshore Oil to the World's Dirtiest Oil?**

The drilling disaster in the Gulf has been a crude awakening for
our country, delivering vivid proof that our reliance on dirty and
dangerous fossil fuels harms ecosystems, workers and our economy.

But the verdict is still out on how our country will respond. Will we
double down on our dependence on oil by seeking new and potentially
dirtier sources of it? Or will we seize this opportunity to put real
solutions in place to propel us toward an oil-free future?

President Obama's leadership is key to determining the outcome. His
administration's decision on whether to approve a new pipeline that
would carry 900,000 barrels of tar sands oil into the United States
each day will indicate whether it is truly committed to closing the
door on dirty energy and

*Contact: Alex Moore, Dirty Fuels Campaigner, amoore@foe.org,

launching us down the path of cleaner, safer alternatives.

This pipeline, called the Keystone XL, would stretch from Alberta,
Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. This pipeline's
approval would enable big oil corporations to expand their destructive
tar sands operations in Alberta and lock our country into reliance
on the dirty crude they produce.

**Every Tank of Tar Sands Oil Accelerates Climate Disruption** Tar
sands oil is a high-carbon fuel that is worse for the climate than
conventional oil, emitting three times more greenhouse gases in the
production process and 20 percent more overall. The oil brought into
the U.S. by the Keystone XL pipeline would have a carbon footprint
equal to adding six million new cars to the roads.

The impacts of climate disruption are already hitting U.S. communities,
from farmers in the Midwest facing declining crop yields to cities and
towns on the Gulf Coast still rebuilding from devastating hurricanes.

Filling up our tanks with the world's dirtiest oil would be a recipe
for accelerated destruction. It's time to cut off the tar sands taps,
not open the floodgates for increased consumption, as the Keystone
XL pipeline would.

**Threatening Public Health from Alberta, Canada to Texas**

Increasing our country's reliance on tar sands oil would be a disaster
for public health from Alberta, Canada to Texas.

The tar sands oil industry is devastating local communities in
Alberta with its massive extraction projects. Companies clear-cut
massive swaths of forest, drain wetlands, and haul away tons of
living matter and soil to set up their mines. The toxic sludge
that is a byproduct is contaminating water supplies of communities
downstream. Villages like Fort Chipewyan have seen soaring cancer
rates. One hundred of the town's 1,200 residents have died from rare
cancers and auto-immune diseases since 2000. Spikes in renal failure,
lupus, and hyperthyroidism are becoming commonplace as well.

At the pipeline's end, Texans would breathe dirtier air. Compared to
conventional oil, tar sands oil spews higher levels of pollutants,
including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter,
into the air when refined. Approving this pipeline would dump further
pollution on refinery communities, which would lead to more smog
blackening the air and more kids getting sick with asthma.

Oil companies are counting on America's thirst for oil to make
expanded investments in the tar sands profitable. The Keystone XL
pipeline would deliver this market into Big Oil's lap, paving the
way for even more harm to local communities on both of its ends.

**We Have Cleaner, Safer Alternatives** Issuing a permit for the
Keystone XL would be an investment in a dirty energy future that we
don't need and can't afford.

Alternatives that can propel us down the path to an oil-free America
include stronger fuel economy standards, investments in public
transportation, and smart growth planning that gives Americans choices
other than cars. Any one of these solutions could offset the demand
for oil that could be satisfied with this pipeline.

**The Obama Administration's Decision-making Process**

Before TransCanada can begin construction, the company needs a
presidential permit from the State Department. The State Department
is in charge of reviewing the project and determining whether it lies
in the national interest. The agency issued its draft environmental
impact statement on the project on April 16, commencing a 60-day
window for public comments and initiating a series of hearings in
states that would be impacted. A final decision on the permit is
expected by the end of this year.

**BP: From Offshore Oil to the World's Dirtiest Oil**

In the wake of the disastrous spill from BP's Deepwater Horizon
offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, BP's attempts to green
its brand as "Beyond Petroleum" have come under close scrutiny.

While the Gulf oil catastrophe has newly tarnished BP's brand in
the United States, the company has been under fire in Europe for
months for its increasing investments in the world's dirtiest oil,
from Canada's tar sands.

**The Dirty Business of Tar Sands Oil Production**

Tar sands oil is a high-carbon fuel that is worse for the climate than
conventional oil, emitting three times more greenhouse gases during
the production process alone. Over the full life-cycle, tar sands
oil produces about 20 percent more greenhouse gases.1 The process
of extracting tar sands oil in Canada is highly land-, water-, and
energy-intensive, requiring the clear cutting of large tracts of
forest and the contamination of millions of gallons of water. The
toxic pools of water left behind pollute water supplies downstream,
causing cancer hot spots in communities. When it is refined, tar sands
oil emits higher levels of air pollutants harmful to human health.

**BP's Investments in Tar Sands Oil Extraction**

BP is investing billions of dollars in new tar sands oil extraction
projects. One new project, called Sunrise, is a joint $3 billion
venture with Canadian oil company Husky. BP's share is $1.5
billion. The project is expected to produce 200,000 barrels of tar
sands oil per day.2 The entire tar sands development is currently
producing 1,200,000 barrels per day,3 and this mine alone would amount
to a 17 percent expansion of production.

In addition to Sunrise, BP is seeking partners for development of
its land at Kirby, another area of tar sands deposits. This mine is
estimated to have a production capacity of 60,000-70,000 barrels of
oil per day.4 Through the Sunrise and Kirby projects, BP would be
producing as many as 34 million gallons of toxic wastewater daily.5

**BP's Tar Sands Oil Refineries**

BP is also expanding its capacity to refine tar sands oil in the
U.S. Its refinery in Whiting, Indiana, is expanding its refining
capacity by 260,000 barrels per day, at a cost of $3.8 billion.6
This expansion has provoked resistance from community members, who
oppose the increased pollution of air and Lake Michigan that would
result. Compared to conventional oil, tar sands oil emits higher
levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter
into the air when refined.7 The refinery expansion would also result
in the release of ammonia and suspended solids into Lake Michigan.8

BP's Toledo, Ohio refinery is also expanding in order to process
120,000 barrels of tar sands oil. This project is in partnership
with Husky.9

**Campaigns Targeting BP's Tar Sands Investments**

Environmental, pension and investor groups in Europe have launched
campaigns aimed at exposing and

*Contact: Alex Moore, Dirty Fuels Campaigner, amoore@foe.org,

halting BP's investments in the tar sands. In April 2010, shareholders
put forth a motion calling on the company to detail the risks of
tar sands development.10 The motion failed, but gained international
attention11 as a sign of the growing movement of pension and other
investors opposed to expanded tar sands development.

**Keystone XL: Pipeline for Dirty Tar Sands Oil**

*The Keystone XL pipeline, proposed by TransCanada, would carry
900,000 barrels of tar sands oil daily from Alberta, Canada to the
Gulf Coast.1 Tar sands have a terrible environmental record as one of
the dirtiest oil sources on Earth. The pipeline will endanger nearby
people and the climate.*

**Tar Sands is Dirty Oil**

Tar sands oil emits three times more greenhouse gases during production
than conventional gasoline.2

About three barrels of water are polluted and dumped in toxic pools
(called tailing ponds) for every barrel of oil produced.3

Tar sands extraction requires strip mining huge tracts of pristine
forest. An area the size of Florida is slated for extraction.

The project harms the lives and health of indigenous people living
downstream from the tar sands operations and has been connected to
high rates of rare cancers, renal failure, lupus, and hyperthyroidism
in the area.4

**The Keystone XL Pipeline**

Replacing the crude oil currently being used by refineries with tar
sands oil will increase our greenhouse gas emissions by 38 million
tons of carbon dioxide per year. This equals the annual emissions of
6 million cars.5

The pipeline will travel more than 1,700 miles through farmland and
fragile ecosystems, such as the Missouri River. Pipeline breaks are
not uncommon, as seen in January 2010, when a pipeline in North Dakota
spilled 126,000 gallons of oil into the surrounding area.6

TransCanada plans to use thin pipe and pump oil at pressures that
exceed the normal allowable limits. The company is seeking a special
permit to operate at this pressure from the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration.

By connecting tar sands oil to the Gulf Coast, the Keystone XL
will make our nation's fuels dirtier and undermine the clean energy
solutions we need to avert catastrophic climate change.

**The Presidential Permit: An Opportunity for Action**

A Nixon-era executive order requires that the Department of State
evaluate all pipeline proposals that cross U.S. borders.

Under the executive order, only pipelines that are determined to be
in the national interest should be granted a Presidential Permit to
cross the border.7

The Obama administration has an opportunity to avert this dangerous
mistake in U.S. energy policy. It is in our national interest to
create a clean energy economy, not increase our reliance on dirty
tar sands oil.

**The Keystone XL Pipeline: Potential Impacts on Natural Resources
and Public Health**

The Keystone XL pipeline, proposed by Canadian oil and gas company
TransCanada, would stretch more than 1,700 miles from Alberta, Canada
across the plains states of Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
and Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast of Texas. The pipeline would traverse
some of the Midwest's most fragile and treasured natural resources,
putting them at risk of contamination from oil spills. At its end
in Texas, communities' health would be damaged by the high levels of
air pollution emitted during the tar sands oil refining process.

**Natural Resources in the Pipeline's Path**

*The Ogallala Aquifer*

More than two million people depend on the Ogallala aquifer for
drinking water.1

The aquifer provides roughly 30 percent of all water used for
irrigation of U.S. farmlands.2

*The Yellowstone River*

The Yellowstone River originates in Yellowstone National park,

and travels 670 miles before merging with the Missouri River.3 Along
with providing water for public use, the Yellowstone River is home
to a wide variety of fish and wildlife.4 *Farmland*

The Keystone XL would cross 469 miles of farmland. 1,269 miles of
the pipeline would cross privately owned land.5

**Pipeline Spills Are a Real Threat**

Canadian-built pipelines have spilled roughly four million gallons
of hazardous materials since 1973.6

From 2002 to 2008, pipeline spills in the U.S. have resulted in more
than $920 million in property

TransCanada is seeking a special permit from the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety

Administration that would allow it to use thinner than normal pipe
that has a smaller percentage of steel. Additionally, the company
wants to pump oil at pressures higher than the legal limit. 8

**The Health Burden in Refinery Communities**

Tar sands refineries emit high levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds into the air,
causing an array of health problems from bronchitis and asthma to
respiratory infections.9

BP and ConocoPhillips are already preparing for additional tar sands
oil by expanding the capacity of their refineries in the U.S. BP is
slated to increase refinery production by 300,000 barrels per day to
make way for the dirty oil.10

**Oil Exploitation in Canada's Tar Sands**

Tar sands oil is a high carbon fuel strip- mined from beneath
Canada's Boreal forest. Fuel from tar sands represents an increasingly
significant portion of the fuel used in cars in the United States. To
extract oil from tar sands, companies must destroy fragile forest
ecosystems and then use a very energy-intensive upgrading and refining
process to turn that oil into transportation fuel. Tar sands mining
and production harm the Boreal forest's fragile ecosystem, waste
enormous amounts of water, and disrupt the lives of indigenous people
in the area.

**Climate Impacts**

Tar sands oil production emits three times more carbon dioxide
compared to the average barrel of conventional oil consumed in the
United States.1 If we expand our use of dirty tar sands, we could
jeopardize the gains we make combating climate change through raising
automobile standards and using renewable power.

**Ecosystem Destruction**

Tar sands extraction requires total destruction of pristine areas
within the Canadian Boreal forest, one of the few large, intact
ecosystems on Earth. The forest is clear cut, the wetlands are
drained, and living matter and soil are hauled away to expose the tar
sands. Oil companies remove and dump four tons of sand and soil for
every one barrel of oil they get from tar sands.2 Oil companies have
so far failed to deliver on their promises to mitigate some of this
destruction by refilling tar sands mines and planting new vegetation.3

**Water Waste**

Extracting the fossil fuels in tar sands from the sand, silt, and clay
requires enormous amounts of water. It takes about three barrels of
water to extract one barrel of oil.4 Over 90 percent of this water,
400 million gallons per day, ends up as toxic waste dumped in massive
pools5 that contain carcinogenic substances like cyanide.6

**Disruption of Native People**

The tar sands are being mined in a region home to many native
people. They have trouble practicing their cultural traditions
because of the destruction caused by tailing ponds and strip mining
operations.7 The people downstream from the toxic tailing ponds have
high rates of rare cancers, renal failure, lupus, and hyperthyroidism.8
Indigenous groups have organized and protested to stop the expansion
of tar

sands operations. This opposition is shared by the majority of
Albertans, with 71 percent supporting a moratorium on new projects
in a recent survey.9

**What We Can Do**

The majority of tar sands oil is exported to the United States. Tar
sands already make up 4 percent of the crude oil we use10 and our tax
dollars are already subsidizing pipelines and refineries that would
allow oil companies to quadruple that amount.11 So far, the Canadian
government and oil companies have not found any buyers of tar sands
oil outside of the United States. As a result, stopping U.S. taxpayer
subsidies for new pipelines and upgraded refineries will go a long
way towards ending oil companies' exploitation of this dirty fuel and
the havoc wrought on the local environment and indigenous people's
livelihoods in the process.

*The following interview was published in Friends of the
Earth's Spring 2010 newsmagazine. It is available online at
http://www.foe.org/interview-mike-mercredi.*

**An Interview with Mike Mercredi, Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations**

*Mike is a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations, an
indigenous community located at Fort Chipewyan (or Fort Chip for short)
in Alberta, Canada. European traders established an outpost here in
1821, and in subsequent years the tar sands industry has sunk its
teeth into the land and the inhabitants.*

**How has the tar sands industry changed life in your community?**

The explanation has to begin with the first European contact. In
1821 they set up a trading post and for a century we were employed
as trappers, coming in from the surrounding land to trade furs for
goods. The community has always been close to the land -- trapping
was not a part of the culture, however living off the land and with
the land, that is our culture. Ever since contact with Europeans,
we have had to adapt our way of living.

Then in 1922 industry started coming in. That year our chief sent
a letter to the government asking them to designate land to us as
traditional lands,

but they didn't reply for some 16-17 years. However later that year,
they passed the Mining Act.

Oil sands have changed the region since the early days of
trapping. Growing up, I was taught to get an education up through
9th grade or to get a GED or even graduate high school and then
get a job working in oil sands. They wanted to recruit us right out
of high school. These days they have programs in the high schools
where they allow the students to go work on site for the oil sands
companies, while they're still in school. These kids get hooked on
the taste of the oil sands money before they are even 18. First they
were weaning people from living off the land to become trappers and
now they're grabbing them right out of school to make them join the
industry. It's all anyone in the community wants to do, because it's
all they're taught; all they're told is that this is the way of the
world, that they need to be a part of the economy.

I was one of those people; I worked at the tar sands for 10 years,
sometimes driving the 400 ton trucks. When I came back to Fort Chip,
some people were aware of what was going on, but the majority of
people lean on the industry, figuring they can't do anything else,
that it's hopeless and they all have to work for the industry. People
have gone and worked for them and then left, having seen what the
industry is doing to the land and the people, but they end up going
back because they have families to feed and need a job.

Scientific studies have come to light, proving the link between the
tar sands industry and rare cancers. People are now wondering, what
is going on here? Now we know which companies are emitting toxins
into the air and water and making people sick.

The Alberta government and industry knew about this all along. They
knew about the effects it would have on health, the damage it would
do to the land, the environmentally devastating effects on people
upstream. So they changed the ways they wrote their Environmental
Impact Assessments so they could pass legislation to allow for mining
of tar sands. As a new generation of government workers came in they
believed the already existing EIAs and they could lean on that. Then
the companies come in and deny that they are causing the problems,
labeling it as hype and trying to skew the statistics. But there
are people in the community who now have diabetes even though they
eat traditional foods cultivated from the land. But the traditional
diet is connected to the water -- the fish that live in the water, the
moose that drink from it -- and that's what's making them sick. All the
sustenance is coming from the water that's released from the tar sands.

*Contact: Alex Moore, Dirty Fuels Campaigner, amoore@foe.org,
202-222-0733*

Some of our elders talk about the spills in the 60s and 70s, before
the environmental acts of 1984 put in place some protections -- these
companies had been running for almost 20 years before that, so you
can imagine the number of spills and the pollution in the water. And
even today, every year when the snow melts, it's the equivalent of
an oil spill. We can measure the toxins in the snow (this is stuff
that comes out of the stacks and settles on the snow), and based on
the amount of the snow melt, you can calculate how much run-off goes
back into the tributaries and aquifers. This is from Syncrude, Suncor,
Albian, and CNRL's. This is besides the oil spills they report on.

Companies have to release what chemicals are coming from their
stacks and so you can track what's coming out of each of the stacks
and point a finger at the companies responsible. A report that came
out in December said that pollution is 50 times higher than what
companies are reporting to the public. They knew from the beginning
the effect it would have, but they changed the legislation to make
it seem like the problems are very small. Alberta Environment cut
funding for scientific studying and now all they do is monitor and
report whether they've exceeded their levels -- they might say the
water quality is bad, but they never go to the company to say that
there's a problem. Several years ago, there were complaints of foul
odors coming from the stacks and all they did was put something on
the tops of the stacks to make the odor less repugnant, rather than
stop putting out those chemicals. We have a whole country run by oil
companies -- doing whatever they can, anyway they can to keep the
oil running, no matter what happens to the people.

**What kind of community organizing is going on in Fort Chip?**

There are a lot of people who have concerns about what they can do
and say -- many work for the oil sands industries, but the children
are doing their own protesting and organizing against it. As for me,
anytime I get a chance to talk about it I do. Last year I toured
to communities in North America affected by industry and tar sands
specifically telling them our story, what we're going through, the
rare cancers being found and the fight we're waging against it. There
are tons of organizations that support Ft Chip, that campaign on
our behalf.

But every time it comes back to the government asking where our
scientific proof is -- well we have it now. What they're going to
do with it, we don't know, because its just come to light in the
past several months. Since the report came out, the companies have
hired a bunch of lawyers, basically they're getting ready to fight,
because somewhere along the line, someone is going to come along and
charge them with genocide -- the killing of a people.

There is no hope with regulatory bodies, they don't work; the
measurements they use have all been broken. Every oil sand company
out there has broken the regulatory agencies rules. A lot of the
companies say they're using the latest technology, but all they're
doing is finding quicker ways of getting the oil out of the ground. And
along the lines, people are still paying the price, people are still
dying. This last week we buried an elder here; he died from cancer. And
yet they're telling the rest of the world we're fine.

They also try to guilt us by saying that they are putting people to
work, and that if you shut it down we're shutting down the economy. But
as far as I say, let it happen, bring it on -- I'd rather that than
have people dying. If they don't do anything about it now, in the long
run we're all going to pay the price. Fort Chip is where the stone
hits the pond and it ripples out -- what happens here you don't want
to happen to the rest of the world. Anyone living within a certain
radius of the plant is going to get sick. They found evidence of the
pollution on some of the plants floating in the Saskatchewan River.

We're also dealing with possible uranium mining around the reserve
and lake -- Fort Chip will be surrounded. Sixty percent of our oil
goes to the states, and 40 percent of that goes to the U.S. military
-- so not only are we going to be fueling their tank trucks, but if
uranium comes to pass, we'll be arming them [the U.S.]. All of this
coming out of the back yard of Fort Chip.

**What response have you gotten from other First Nations in Canada
and tribes in the U.S.?**

They all say fight against it and try to find ways of educating
people. No company has offered anything beyond jobs to these
communities, yet according to the treaties signed which agree to
sharing the land and all its resources, we should be getting a
share. Well, where's our share? Why are First Nations still living
in third world conditions in a

*Contact: Alex Moore, Dirty Fuels Campaigner, amoore@foe.org,

first world country? If they followed the treaty we'd be just as rich
as they are. The problem is, they [the Canadian government] made the
leases privatized to sell them to multi-national corporations to come
in and mine the oil sands here.

**What one message would you like to send to the readers?**

Boycott oil sands products, find out which companies use oil sands
oil, which ones are selling and using the stuff. There are several
companies that have upped the ante refusing to conduct commerce with
the companies that use dirty tar sands. If the Obama administration
wanted to go to a green economy, wanted to change how we do things,
one of the things they can do is change where they get oil from,
which is the oil sands. Americans should know that not only are the
people of Fort Chip and Alberta, Canada, supplying them oil but also
fueling the army tanks, but arming them too. If they're against war,
they won't want this to happen.
