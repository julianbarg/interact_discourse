**ES.4.1 Climate Change**

Changes to the Earth's climate have been observed over the past century
with a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit between
1880 and 2012. This warming has coincided with increased levels of
GHGs in the atmosphere. In order for the Earth's heat and energy
to remain at a steady state, the solar energy that is incoming must
equal the energy that is radiated into space (see Figure ES-9). GHGs
contribute to trapping outbound radiation within the troposphere
(the layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth's surface), and
this is called the greenhouse effect.

**Figure ES-9 The Greenhouse Effect**

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the rate and amount
of GHGs have increased as a result of human activity. The additional
GHGs intensify the greenhouse effect, resulting in a greater amount of
heat being trapped within the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts
from countries around the world, in its Fifth Assessment Report
concludes that global warming in the climate system is unequivocal
based on measured increases in temperature, decrease in snow cover,
and higher sea levels.

This Supplemental EIS evaluates the relationship between the proposed
Project with respect to GHG emissions and climate change from the
following perspectives:

• The GHG emissions associated with the construction and operation
of the proposed Project and its connected actions;

• The potential increase in indirect lifecycle (wells- to-wheels)
GHG emissions associated with the WCSB crude oil that would be
transported by the proposed Project;

• How the GHG emissions associated with the proposed Project
cumulatively contribute to climate change; and

• An assessment of the effects that future projected climate change
could have in the proposed Project area and on the proposed Project.

**ES.4.1.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the**

**Proposed Project**

The proposed Project would emit approximately 0.24 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents (MMTCO2e) per year during
the construction period. These emissions would be emitted directly
through fuel use in construction vehicles and equipment, as well as,
land clearing activities including open burning, and indirectly from
electricity usage.

During operations, approximately 1.44 MMTCO2e would be emitted per
year, largely attributable to electricity use for pump station power,
fuel for vehicles and aircraft for maintenance and inspections,
and fugitive methane emissions at connections. The 1.44 MMTCO2e
emissions would be equivalent to GHG emissions from approximately
300,000 passenger vehicles operating for 1 year, or 71,928 homes
using electricity for 1 year.

**ES.4.1.2 Lifecycle Analysis**

To enable a more comprehensive understanding of the potential indirect
GHG impact of the proposed Project, it is important to also consider
the wider GHG emissions associated with the crude oil being transported
by the proposed Project. A lifecycle approach was used to evaluate
the GHG implications of the WCSB crudes that would be transported by
the proposed Project compared to other crude oils that would likely
be replaced or displaced by those WCSB crudes in U.S. refineries. A
lifecycle analysis is a technique used to evaluate the environmental
aspects and impacts (in this case GHGs) that are associated with a
product, process, or service from raw materials acquisition through
production, use, and end-of-life. The lifecycle analysis considered
wells-to-wheels GHG emissions, including extraction, processing,
transportation, refining, and refined product use (such as combustion
of gasoline in cars) of WCSB crudes compared to other reference
heavy crudes. The lifecycle analysis also considered the implications
associated with other generated products during the lifecycle stages
(so-called *co-products*) such as petroleum coke. WCSB crudes are
generally more GHG intensive than other heavy crudes they would
replace or displace in U.S. refineries, and emit an estimated 17
percent more GHGs on a lifecycle basis than the average barrel of
crude oil refined in the United States in 2005. The largest single
source of GHG emissions in the lifecycle analysis is the finished-fuel
combustion of refined petroleum fuel products, which is consistent
for different crude oils, as shown in Figure ES-10.

The total lifecycle emissions associated with production, refining, and
combustion of 830,000 bpd of oil sands crude oil transported through
the proposed Project is approximately 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year. The
annual lifecycle GHG emissions from 830,000 bpd of the four reference
crudes examined in this Supplemental EIS are estimated to be 124 to
159 MMTCO2e. The range of incremental GHG emissions for crude oil that
would be transported by the proposed Project is estimated to be 1.3 to
27.4 MMTCO2e annually. The estimated range of potential emissions is
large because there are many variables such as which reference crude
is used for the comparison and which study is used for the comparison.

The above estimates represent the total incremental emissions
associated with production and consumption of 830,000 bpd of oil sands
crude compared to the reference crudes. These estimates represent the
potential increase in emissions attributable to the proposed Project
if one assumed that approval or denial of the proposed Project would
directly result in a change in production of 830,000 bpd of oil
sands crudes in Canada (See Section 4.14.4.2, Emissions and Impacts
in Context, for additional information on emissions associated with
increases in oil sands production). However, as set forth in Section
1.4, Market Analysis, such a change is not likely to occur under
expected market conditions. Section 1.4 notes that approval or denial
of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed Project,
is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil
sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the
United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs,
transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.

The 2013 Draft Supplemental EIS estimated how oil sands production
would be affected by long-term constraints on pipeline capacity (if
such constraints resulted in higher transportation costs) if long-term
WTI-equivalent oil prices were less than $100 per barrel. The Draft
Supplemental EIS also estimated a change in GHG emissions associated
with such changes in production. The additional data and analysis
included in this Supplemental EIS provide greater insights into
supply costs and the range of prices in which pipeline constraints
would be most likely to impact production. If WTI-equivalent prices
fell to around approximately $65 to $75 per barrel, if there were
long-term constraints on any new pipeline capacity, and if such
constraints resulted in higher transportation costs, then there could
be a substantial impact on oil sands production levels. As noted in
E.S.3.1, Summary of Market Analysis, this estimated price threshold
could change if supply costs or production expectations prove different
than estimated in this analysis. This is discussed in Section 1.4.5.4,
Implications for Production.

**ES.4.1.3 Climate Change Effects**

The total direct and indirect emissions associated with the proposed
Project would contribute to cumulative global GHG emissions. However,
emissions associated with the proposed Project are only one source of
relevant GHG emissions. In that way, GHG emissions differ from other
impact categories discussed in this Supplemental EIS in that all GHG
emissions of the same magnitude contribute to global climate change
equally, regardless of the source or geographic location where they
are emitted.

As part of this Supplemental EIS, future climate change scenarios
and projections developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change and peer- reviewed downscaled models were used to evaluate
the effects that climate change could have on the proposed Project,
as well as the environmental consequences from the proposed Project.

Assuming construction of the proposed Project were to occur in the
next few years, climate conditions during the construction period
would not differ substantially from current conditions. However,
during the subsequent operational time period, the following climate
changes are anticipated to occur regardless of any potential effects
from the proposed Project:

• Warmer winter temperatures;

• A shorter cool season;

• A longer duration of frost-free periods;

• More freeze-thaw cycles per year (which could lead to an increased
number of episodes of soil contraction and expansion);

• Warmer summer temperatures;

• Increased number of hot days and consecutive hot days; and

• Longer summers (which could lead to impacts associated with heat
stress and wildfire risks).

This Supplemental EIS assessed whether the projected changes in the
climate could further influence the impacts and effects attributable to
the proposed Project. Elevated effects due to projected climate change
could occur to water resources, wetlands, terrestrial vegetation,
fisheries, and endangered species, and could also contribute to air
quality impacts. In addition, the statistical risk of a pipeline spill
could be increased by secondary effects brought on by climatic change
such as increased flooding and drought. However, this increased risk
would still be much less than the risk of spills from other causes
(such as third-party damage). Climate change could have an effect
on the severity of a spill such that it could be reduced in drought
conditions but increased during periods of increased precipitation
and flooding.
