## 3.2.2.4 Greenhouse Gases

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and NO2 are all naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHGs) whose concentrations in the atmosphere have increased as a result of human activities since the dawn of the industrial revolution. 
GHGs in general and CO2 in particular, have become an issue of intense public debate and much recent litigation. 
In Massachusetts vs. the US EPA, the US Supreme Court held that CO2 satisfies the definition of "air pollutant" and that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other GHGs from new motor vehicles under the CAA (Massachusetts vs. the US EPA, 2007). 
It is important to note that the Court did not rule that CO2 and other GHGs were subject to regulation under the CAA, nor did the Court require creation of any standards or emission control requirements for GHGs.

CO2, CH4, and NO2 are not criteria pollutants for which NAAQS are set, nor are they regulated under NSPS, MACT, or any other CAA regulatory emission standard or limitation. 
Therefore, although CO2 was defined as being an air pollutant, it is not a regulated air pollutant for CAA regulatory and permitting purposes. 
No regulatory limitations or other CAA emission standards apply to CO2, CH4 or NO2.
