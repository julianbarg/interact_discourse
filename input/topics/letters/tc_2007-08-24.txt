Re: Tract Number ML-SD-MR-0519.0000

Dear Mr. Anderson,

TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. ("Keystone"), a subsidiary of
TransCanada, has filed an application with the South Dakota Public
Utilities Commission for permission to construct a crude oi! pipeline
in the state of South Dakota. While regulatory reviews proceed,
Keystone continues to make preparations for construction. In order
to meet the ueed for delivery of crude oi] to refineries starting
in the fourth quarter of 2009, Keystone intends to initiate pipeline
construction in South Dakota in May, 2008.

As detatled below, this letter presents Keystone's Final Offer for
the purchase of an easement across property you own or in which
you have an interest (identified below) for the construction of the
Keystone crude oi] pipeline. We jook forward to your response and to
the successful completion of negotiations for this easement.

We have previously expressed te you our interest in acquiring this
casement. The property ownership is listed as Raymond G. Anderson. The
easement located in portions of Section 14,Township 125 North, Range
59 West, 5â„¢ P.M., described as Parcel 16.59.14.1000 in that certain
deed dated 10/7/1969 recorded as Document Number 10856, of Official
Records of Marshall County, South Dakota.

As our Fynal Offer, Keystone offers to pay you $7,812.00 for the
permanent easement on 3.1 acres and $4. 914, 00 for the temporary
construction easement on 3.9 acres, for a total of $12, 726.00. z

Keystone negotiates in good faith for all land rights and pays fair
value :-or those rights.

We believe this offer provides payment that is just and reasonable,
and ajequately compensates you for Keystone's use of the land.

Our offer will remain in effect untit August 31, 2007. If this offer
is acceptable, please have two of the copies of the enclosed easement
executed by the person or persons authorized to enter into such
agreements by August 31, 2007 in the presence of a Notary Public, and
return them to me in the enclosed postage paid envelope. {mmediately
afier receipt of the properly signed and notarized easements, we will
deliver fo you a check in the agreed upon amount.

Should you reject or fail to respond to this offer by August 31, 2007,
Keystone will conclude that we are unable to come to agreement on a
voluntarily negotiated casement for this project. We will then commence
preparations for a condemnation action to acquire the easements under
the laws of the State of South Dakota.

In more than 50 years of building and operating our 36,500 mite
pipeline system, TransCanada has used eminent domain very sparingly. We
are committed to extending that positive record. Our preference is to
reach an amiable arrangement with respect to acquiling an easement
for the Keystone pipeline. A condemnation action can be avoided if
we can reach an agreement on this matter. We hope you will find this
offer acceptable. If you have any questions about this offer, please
contact either myself at 1-800-562-8931 or alternatively, John Hunt,
Land Manager, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. at
