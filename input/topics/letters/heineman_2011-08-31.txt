I am writing to you today regarding a very important issue to the State
of Nebraska and to our citizens- the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am opposed
to the proposed route of this pipeline. The Final Environmental Impact
Statement compares a potential spill in the Sand Hills region to a 1979
Bemidji, Minnesota spill and concludes that “the impacts to shallow
groundwater from a spill of a similar volume in the Sand Hills region
would affect a limited area of the aquifer around the spill site.”
I disagree with this analysis, and I believe that the pipeline should
not cross a substantial portion of the Ogallala Aquifer.

Of the current proposed route, 254 miles of the pipeline would
come through Nebraska and be situated directly over the Ogallala
Aquifer. The aquifer provides water to farmers and ranchers of Nebraska
to raise livestock and grow crops. Nebraska has 92,685 registered,
active irrigation wells supplying water to over 8.5 million acres
of harvested cropland and pasture. Forty-six percent of the total
cropland harvested during 2007 was irrigated.

Maintaining and protecting Nebraska's water supply is very important
to me and the residents of Nebraska. This resource is the lifeblood of
Nebraska’s agriculture industry.  Cash receipts from farm marketings
contribute over $17 billion to Nebraska’s economy annually. I am
concerned that the proposed pipeline will potentially have detrimental
effects on this valuable natural resource and Nebraska's economy.

I want to emphasize that I am not opposed to pipelines. We already have
hundreds of them in our state. I am opposed to the proposed Keystone
XL Pipeline route because it is directly over the Ogallala Aquifer.

Therefore, I am asking you to disapprove TransCanada’s pending
permit request. Do not allow TransCanada to build a pipeline over
the Ogallala Aquifer and risk the potential damage to Nebraska's
water. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
