Call special session on Keystone

Sep 3, 2011 0

Wednesday morning I heard some great news. Gov. Dave Heineman wrote a
letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, but he continues to drag his
own feet, saying the ball is in the hands of our federal government.

Sen. Ben Nelson, on the other hand, said Gov. Heineman could do
something about making TransCanada reroute the pipeline.

Personally, I believe all of them could do something, but won't.

TransCanada has been passing out money like it is confetti in order
to make us all believe that it is going to be such a great steward
of our land and add great economic benefits for us all. Big Oil and
their pipeline history proves otherwise, and so, too, will their
promises of USA's reliance on foreign oil.

They have much to gain with their refined oil in the Gulf: worldwide
markets, an already contaminated Gulf to cover their pollution tracks
and a country that gives them lifetime use of our land to transport
their oil.

It would seem that easements with landowners should have a termination
date.

Gov. Heineman could call a special session so our Legislature possibly
could find a solution or protection for Nebraska's natural resources,
protection against foreign or corporate land use and clean water
rights for all of our citizens, but he complained that it would cost
$10,000 a day.

Ten thousand dollars a day seems like a very minor expense to
provide our elected officials time to debate the future of Nebraska's
Ogallala Aquifer. That is a small price to pay to protect our most
needed resource.
