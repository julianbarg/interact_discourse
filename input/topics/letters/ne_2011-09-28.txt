Wanting it both ways?

Sep 27, 2011 0


According to the headline in the Sept. 22 Journal Star, the governor
is asking Nebraskans to speak up about the Keystone XL Pipeline. I
respectfully ask the governor whether he needs to have his hearing aids
adjusted to the Nebraska frequency, not just the TransCanada frequency.

Some 64 percent of Nebraskans say they would support a ballot
proposition to authorize the state to regulate oil pipeline
routes. Gov. Dave Heineman said he had met with TransCanada executives
twice in the past 10 days, and a Canadian foreign minister was coming
to talk to him.

My question: Has the governor also met with equally highly placed
anti-XL pipeline spokespersons, such as Bill McKibben, who offer an
alternative viewpoint? Or is he just listening to the deep pockets
on this issue?

Those of us who speak for Nebraska interests and for scientific
and environmental concerns are no match for the Canadian corporate
interests that  have Heineman's ear.

While he has said he would support the relocation of the pipeline,
the governor adds that he doesn't think TransCanada would be willing
to move it. That certainly sounds like Heineman wants to have it both
ways. We may as well raise up the maple leaf flag over the Nebraska
Capitol, and God bless the Queen.
