President Obama:

We are researchers at work on the science of climate change and allied
fields. We are writing to add our voices to the indigenous leaders,
religious leaders, and environmentalists calling on you to block the
proposed Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada’s tar sands.

The tar sands are a huge pool of carbon, but one that does not make
sense to exploit.  It takes a lot of energy to extract and refine
this resource into useable fuel, and the mining is environmentally
destructive.  Adding this on top of conventional fossil fuels will
leave our children and grandchildren a climate system with consequences
that are out of their control.  It makes no sense to build a pipeline
system that would practically guarantee extensive exploitation of
this resource.

When other huge oil fields or coal mines were opened in the past,
we knew much less about the damage that the carbon they contained
would do to the Earth’s climate system and to its oceans. Now
that we do know, it’s imperative that we move quickly to alternate
forms of energy—and that we leave the tar sands in the ground. We
hope those so inclined will join protests scheduled for August and
described at tarsandsaction.org.

If the pipeline is to be built, you as president have to declare that
it is “in the national interest.” As scientists, speaking for
ourselves and not for any of our institutions, we can say categorically
that it’s not only not in the national interest, it’s also not
in the planet’s best interest.

Sincerely,
