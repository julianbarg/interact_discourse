Pipeline not in national interest

Sep 8, 2011

The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not in the national
interest. Unless the State Department responds to the requests of our
governor and our senators to relocate the pipeline, it would cross
the ecologically sensitive Nebraska Sandhills. This is a fragile area
with few pipelines of any kind.

This 36-inch tar sands oil pipeline would eventually run at a capacity
of 830,000 barrels of oil per day. "By comparison, the pipeline
that leaked 840,000 gallons (the equivalent of 20,000 barrels) into
Michigan's Kalamazoo River in July 2010 has a capacity of just 190,000
barrels a day," SolveClimate News reported. "According to the State
Department's final EIS, the Keystone XL's leak detection system will
be able to detect spills down to 1.5-2.0 percent of the pipeline's
total flow rate. â€¦ Assuming a 830,000 barrels-per-day capacity,
(this) comes out to a volume of 520,000 to 700,000 gallons."

A spill like this could be devastating to this fragile area and the
aquifer. I believe that risking contamination to our precious water
and food resources is morally irresponsible.
