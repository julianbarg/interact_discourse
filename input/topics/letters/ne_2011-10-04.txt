Heineman needs to act

Oct 3, 2011 0

I was very impressed when Gov. Dave Heineman submitted an open letter
to the Obama administration asking it to deny the permit allowing
the Keystone XL pipeline to be built. It was a bold move and showed
a willingness to fight for the future and livelihood of Nebraskans.

That pride was short-lived. This week, Heineman's statements indicate,
at best, a defeatist attitude, and at worst, capitulation. It was made
clear in the Final Environmental Impact Statement released last month
that states can indeed dictate routing of pipelines, but that without
such policy, siting defaults to the feds. This is a crucial matter
for our state and its economy, and failing to take action because of
uncertainty about what action could be taken is simply ridiculous.

I urge Heineman to call a special legislative session immediately
and ask our elected lawmakers to craft policy that safeguards our
Sandhills. If they fail to stand up for what's right for Nebraska,
let's be honest -- that's on them. Rest assured, we the people and
voters of Nebraska certainly will remember whom to blame if (or when)
our aquifer is ruined by corrosive chemicals and tar sands oil.

In any case, blaming the feds, refusing to take action and calling
the Keystone XL pipeline likely a "done deal" are unacceptable. In
this Nebraskan's estimation, Heineman now stands at a crossroads:
He could choose to be remembered for standing by and complaining or
for standing up for Nebraskans against the Obama administration when
it really counted. If you ask me, it's no choice at all. Fighting
and losing is always better than forfeiting.

Heineman's hands are not tied. But it's time to roll up his sleeves.
