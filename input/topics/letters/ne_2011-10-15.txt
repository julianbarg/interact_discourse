Pass pipeline bill

Oct 14, 2011 0

Last Saturday's come-from-behind victory at Memorial Stadium was an
inspiring demonstration of what the Cornhusker spirit can do when we
believe in ourselves and pull together to defend our turf. This same
spirit has been evident in our battle to defend the Nebraska Sandhills
and the Ogallala Aquifer from the threat of TransCanada to roll over
our state with its Keystone XL pipeline and impose on us the risk of
spoiling these precious resources.

Even though the score may not be in our favor at this stage of the
game, we must believe in ourselves and our right to defend what is
essential to us and to future generations. We have the right and
the duty to put into law the safeguards necessary to protect the
Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer by requiring an alternate route
for the pipeline.

Our quarterback, Gov. Dave Heineman, must not be intimidated and cannot
let the clock run out on this matter. He must call the winning play
of a special session, and our legislative team must pull together to
carry Sen. Annette Dubas' bill over the goal line. We cannot afford
to lose this game.
