Dismayed by Heineman

Aug 17, 2011 0

I was dismayed (LJS, Aug. 5) that Gov. Dave Heineman will not call
for a special session of the Legislature to protect the Ogallala
Aquifer, even though he admits that a majority of Nebraskans (including
himself) believe that the Keystone XL Pipeline should not go through
the Sandhills.

He believes this should have been taken care of in the regular session,
that a special session is too expensive, and that the votes to pass
a bill are not there.

During the regular session, the senators did not feel they had the
authority to determine a pipeline's route through the state. It is
now clear they do have that authority, and Sen. Ken Haar is trying
to make that correction.

While it is true that a special session would be expensive, when
measured against protecting our state's greatest natural resource --
the aquifer -- the cost would be well worth it.

As for votes, when the issue is this important and the majority want
it, it is the governor's duty to lead and work to get the senators'
support.

If the governor keeps passively sitting on the fence much longer, it
will be too late. All the power will be in the hands of TransCanada,
a foreign corporation.

Gov. Heineman needs to do something.
