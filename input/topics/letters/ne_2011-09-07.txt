Heineman should call session

Sep 6, 2011 0

All of us who own cars must admit that we make use of the very oil
that is choking our planet. Even as we drive to the mall, we admit
to discomfort about being "dependent" upon oil from tenuous sources.

However, it does not follow that the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline
is a good thing. There is no reason for TransCanada to insist that
this pipeline flow through our Sandhills and our Ogallala Aquifer,
especially when a safer route exists.

Oil may be precious, but water is a necessity. Even TransCanada's
most optimistic predictions allow for leaks. Are we willing to risk
ruining the very water we drink and use for irrigation?

I urge Gov. Dave Heineman to call a special legislative session so
that we may find a way to insist upon rerouting the pipeline away
from our state's lifeblood.
