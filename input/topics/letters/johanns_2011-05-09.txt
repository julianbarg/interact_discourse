Thank you for your work on the Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement (Supplemental) for the Keystone XL pipeline. As you know,
I am concerned that the pipeline's route unnecessarily places portions
of Nebraska's Sand Hills region at risk.

Although I was pleased to see that the Supplemental included analysis
of additional routes that would avoid substantial portions of the
Sand Hills region, I remain disappointed that the analysis continues
to consider the proposed route as the preferred route. I believe that
the pipeline should be built on a route that avoids to the maximum
extent possible the Sand Hills region and the center of the Ogallala
Aquifer, and the proposed route fails to accomplish that goal.

As you continue to execute your duties under Presidential Order 13337,
please consider extending the comment period or otherwise ensuring
that Nebraskans have sufficient time to review the Supplemental. Its
contents are substantial and a thorough review may require additional
time.

Please also consider asking your staff to visit the Sand Hills region
in Nebraska. A field hearing within the proposed route area would
be a beneficial way for your staff to have a clear understanding of
the area outlined in the study and potentially inform your decision
regarding the pipeline.

Thank you for your consideration and attention to this matter.
