**ES.4.3 Socioeconomics**

**ES.4.3.1 Economic Activity Overview**

During construction, proposed Project spending would support
approximately 42,100 jobs (direct, indirect, and induced), and
approximately $2 billion in earnings throughout the United States. Of
these jobs, approximately 3,900 would be direct construction jobs
in the proposed Project area in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska,
and Kansas (3,900 over 1 year of construction, or 1,950 per year
if construction took 2 years). Construction of the proposed Project
would contribute approximately $3.4 billion (or 0.02 percent) to the
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The proposed Project would generate
approximately 50 jobs during operations. Property tax revenue during
operations would be substantial for many counties, with an increase
of 10 percent or more in 17 of the 27 counties with proposed Project
facilities.

The jobs and earnings analysis recognizes three distinct components
of economic activity and job creation: direct, indirect, and induced.

• Direct economic activity associated with construction includes
all jobs and earnings at firms that are awarded contracts for goods
and services, including construction, directly by Keystone.

• Indirect economic activity includes all goods and services
purchased by these construction contractors in the conduct of
their services to the proposed Project. Examples of these types
of activities related to pipeline construction include the goods
and services purchased to produce inputs such as concrete, fuel,
surveying, welding materials, and earth-moving equipment.

• Induced economic activity includes the spending of earnings
received by employees working for either the construction contractor
or for any supplier of goods and services required in the construction
process. Examples of induced activities include spending by access
road construction crews, welders, employees of pipe manufacturers,
and ranchers providing beef for restaurants and construction camps.

**ES.4.3.2 Pipeline Geography, Population**

Of the land area near the proposed pipeline route, approximately 17
percent intersects areas with low- income or minority populations,
including Indian tribes. Such populations could potentially be
disproportionately affected by the proposed Project.

The proposed pipeline route would go through 27 counties: six in
Montana, nine in South Dakota, and 12 in Nebraska. These counties
are referred to as the *pipeline corridor counties* and would be
expected to experience most of the direct socioeconomic effects of
the proposed Project.

The 27 pipeline corridor counties are predominantly rural and sparsely
populated, with a total population of approximately 263,300 (2010
Census). Population density (number of persons per square mile) is low.

**ES.4.3.3 Economic Activity During**

**Construction**

Construction contracts, materials, and support purchased in the United
States would total approximately $3.1 billion. Another approximately
$233 million would be spent on construction camps for workers in
remote locations of Montana, South Dakota, and northern Nebraska.

Construction of the proposed Project would contribute approximately
$3.4 billion to the U.S. GDP. This figure includes not only earnings
by workers, but all other income earned by businesses and individuals
engaged in the production of goods and services demanded by the
proposed Project, such as profits, rent, interest, and dividends. When
compared with the GDP in 2012, the proposed Project's contribution
represents approximately 0.02 percent of annual economic activity
across the nation.

Construction spending would support a combined total of approximately
42,100 jobs throughout the United States for the up to 2-year
construction period. A *job* consists of one position that is filled
for one year. The term *support* means jobs ranging from new jobs
(i.e., not previously existing) to the continuity of existing jobs in
current or new locations. The specific number of jobs at any location
would result from the individual decisions of employers across the
country affected by the proposed Project based on their labor needs,
work backlog, and local hiring conditions. Of these jobs, approximately
16,100 would be direct jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for
goods and services, including construction, by Keystone. The other
approximately 26,000 jobs would result from indirect and induced
spending; this would consist of goods and services purchased by the
construction contractors and spending by employees working for either
the construction contractor or for any supplier of goods and services
required in the construction process.

About 12,000 jobs, or 29 percent of the total 42,100 jobs, would
be supported in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas. Also,
of the 42,100 jobs, approximately 3,900 (or 1,950 per year if
construction took 2 years) would comprise a direct, temporary,
construction workforce in the proposed Project area.

Employment supported by construction of the proposed Project would
translate to approximately $2.05 billion in employee earnings. Of
this, approximately 20 percent ($405 million in earnings) would
be allocated to workers in the proposed Project area states. The
remaining 80 percent, or $1.6 billion, would occur in other locations
around the country.

**ES.4.3.4 Economic Activity During**

**Operations**

Once the proposed Project enters service, operations would require
approximately 50 total employees in the United States: 35 permanent
employees and 15 temporary contractors. This small number would result
in negligible impacts on population, housing, and public services in
the proposed Project area.

The total estimated property tax from the proposed Project in the first
full year of operations would be approximately $55.6 million spread
across 27 counties in three states. This impact to local property tax
revenue receipts would be substantial for many counties, constituting
a property tax revenue benefit of 10 percent or more in 17 of these
27 counties. Operation of the proposed Project is not expected to
have an impact on residential or agricultural property values.
