**6.1.1.1 Construction Labor**

Labor Overview

The Project construction work will be temporary. The pipeline
and facilities will be constructed utilizing organized labor from
union locals whose geographic jurisdictions include South Dakota for
the United Association, Teamsters, Operators, and Laborers. Each of
these labor unions has requirements for joining their unions and also
provides training and apprenticeship programs for new members.

Local Labor Needs and Benefits

Approximately 500 to 600 construction personnel (Keystone employees,
contractor employees, construction inspection staff, and environmental
inspection staff) are expected to be associated with each construction
spread. The current construction plan involves 2 full construction
spreads in 2011 in South Dakota with a total of approximately 1,000
to 1,200 pipeline construction personnel, and 1 full and 2 partial
construction spreads in 2012. Construction of pump stations will
require an additional 20 to 30 workers per station, resulting in
a total of approximately 1,100 to 1,400 workers in the State at
the peak of construction. Not all pump stations will be constructed
simultaneously. Construction of pump stations is to commence in 2011
and be completed in 2012.

The job classifications and number of personnel estimated for
construction of the pipeline in South Dakota based on two construction
spreads in 2011 are provided in **Table 16**.

The net economic effect on local communities should be positive for
the duration of the construction period.

Food and lodging expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $20
million. Temporary workers' estimated retail purchases with added state
and local government taxes will add approximately $6 to 8 million of
additional revenue.

Keystone will purchase some construction materials and other supplies
for the Project from local businesses. Local purchases for construction
will include consumables, fuel, equipment maintenance, equipment
rental, space leasing, miscellaneous construction-related materials
such as office supplies, and some medical/dental needs. It is estimated
that local materials purchase costs will exceed $14 to 16 million.

Construction of the Project will result in short-term benefits to
the local communities.

Local Labor Resources

Keystone expects that its construction contractors will hire temporary
construction personnel from the local communities where possible. It is
estimated that approximately 10 to 15 percent of the total construction
work force could be hired locally, with the remaining portion (85 to
90 percent or more) consisting of non-local personnel.

Utilization of available labor in South Dakota for pipeline
construction will be limited to persons that are current union members
or join the referenced labor unions. Since pipeline construction is
very specialized, it is likely most local hiring will be for office
staff, general labor or truck drivers.

The number of construction workers that will be hired locally will vary
by contractor and by the availability of residents who are specifically
trained and available for pipeline construction employment.

**6.1.1.2 Operations Labor**

A limited number of contract employees will be required for operations
and maintenance activities. The total number of permanent employees
will not result in significant additions to the total work force of
the region.
