**ES.5 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED**

Alternatives to the Keystone Project were analyzed to determine
whether they would be reasonable and environmentally preferable to
the proposed action. A No Action Alternative, system alternatives,
major route alternatives, route variations, and aboveground facility
site alternatives were considered in the EIS. Identification of
alternatives to the proposed project incorporated public comments
and input received from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.

**ES.5.1 No Action Alternative**

Under the No Action Alternative, the Keystone Project would not be
constructed and operated and issuance of a DOS Presidential Permit for
the specific action of building and operating the Keystone pipeline
would not be required. While this alternative would eliminate the
environmental impacts directly associated with the Keystone Project,
it would not meet the proposed action's purpose and need, which
involve both supply and demand components.

Without the Keystone Project, the increasing supply of crude oil
from the WCSB would not have a ready conduit for export to available
refineries and markets in the United States. Additional export pipeline
capacity above supply requirements also is required to avoid potential
situations where short-term supply exceeds export pipeline capacity.

U.S. demand for petroleum products has increased, while domestic
U.S. crude oil supplies continue to decline. The No Action Alternative
would not provide the United States with a relatively stable and

secure source of North American crude oil for Midwest and Gulf Coast
markets, thereby continuing increasing U.S. dependence on less reliable
sources of oil with higher associated shipping costs.

While the increasing demand for refined crude oil products could
be met by other projects or alternatives, it is purely speculative
to predict the resulting effects and actions that could be taken by
local governments and other suppliers or refineries in the region,
as well as any associated direct and indirect environmental impacts
of these actions. In addition, each of these actions may result in
environmental impacts that are less than, equal to, or greater than
those of the currently proposed Keystone Project. The No Action
Alternative also could result in more expensive and less reliable
crude oil supplies for Midwestern refineries, increasing costs and
availability of the refined products for end-users.

**ES.5.2 System Alternatives**

Several existing and proposed crude oil pipeline systems that
currently or would eventually serve the markets targeted by the
proposed Keystone Project were assessed. The analysis considered
whether those systems would meet the proposed Project objectives
while offering an environmental advantage over the proposed Project.

One system alternative considered was the expansion of the existing
Express and Platte Pipeline systems. This 1,700-mile pipeline system
transports crude oil from Alberta's oil sands in Hardisty, Alberta
to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions. In
the United States, the pipeline crosses Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska,
Kansas, and Missouri and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The
Express system has been in operation from 1997, with a current
capacity of 280,000 bpd. The Platte pipeline was built in 1952, and
its current capacity is 164,000 bpd. However, as operated today,
neither of these existing systems would have the capacity of the
proposed Keystone pipeline (435,000 bpd, with a potential increase to
591,000 bpd). As they exist today, neither system could be considered
as a system alternative for the proposed action

New construction of other crude oil pipeline systems (Alberta
Clipper, Southern Lights, and Spearhead Cushing Expansion) was also
considered. Enbridge is proposing these expansion projects to help
address current and future increases in refinery demand as supply
from western Canada's vast oil sands increases. The Enbridge projects
propose to deliver crude oil directly to Midwestern markets. However,
the proposed Enbridge pipelines would provide a less direct route
to the Cushing refineries than the Cushing Extension portion of the
Keystone Project, involving the need for additional miles of pipe
and likely incurring additional impacts to resources. In addition,
these projects aim to fulfill other market demands and would not
meet the market need and in-service date proposed by the Keystone
Project. Therefore, as noted in Section ES.3.5 above, it is possible
that market demand and supply of WCSB crude could support construction
of the Keystone Project and the Enbridge projects.

**ES.5.3 Major Route Alternatives**

Three major route alternatives are considered in the EIS: the Iowa
Route Alternative, the Proposed Route Alternative, and the Direct
Route Alternative. During initial screening, it was determined that
the Iowa Route Alternative did not meet the purpose and need for
the Project, and the alternative was not considered further in the
analysis. Table ES-4 summarizes the potential impacts of the remaining
two alternatives, and the following sections discuss these alternatives
in more detail. Based on the analysis of the two alternatives, the
Proposed Route Alternative has been determined to be the preferred
route and a resource-by-resource analysis of potential impacts is
conducted in this EIS. Section ES.6 summarizes the results of the
analysis.

**ES.5.3.1 Iowa Route Alternative**

Initial route development identified a ROW that avoided Nebraska
and crossed Iowa into northern Missouri (Figure 4.3-1). Desktop data
analysis, along with limited aerial and ground reconnaissance, was
used to identify this route. The Iowa Route entered the United States
in Pembina County, North Dakota, just north of Walhalla, and ran due
south to the North Dakota/South Dakota border. In South Dakota, the
route ran generally south to the Spink County border before turning
southeast toward Plymouth County, Iowa. From there, it crossed the
South Dakota/Iowa border north of Sioux City, Iowa and continued in
a southeasterly direction through Iowa and Missouri toward a delivery
point at Salisbury, Missouri.

Here, the Iowa Route was collocated with the existing Platte pipeline
to Troy, Missouri. North of Troy, the route was moved to a power line
ROW to avoid areas where the city has expanded. East of Troy, the
route again collocated with the Platte pipeline, running east to the
Missouri/Illinois border---where it deviated from the Platte pipeline
and crossed the Mississippi River south of Wood River, Illinois. From
Wood River, the route ran eastward through the Carlyle Lake WMA into
Patoka, Illinois.

While the Iowa Route would meet the objectives of crude oil delivery
to the refineries in Illinois, it would not efficiently deliver crude
oil to Cushing, Oklahoma and would not meet the Keystone Project
purpose and need, and is not considered further.

**ES.5.3.2 Direct Alternative**

The Direct Alternative was designed to take the shortest feasible
route between the U.S./Canada border crossing and the delivery
points at Patoka and Wood River, Illinois, and from there to take
the shortest route to the delivery point at Cushing, Oklahoma (Figure
4.3-2). The straight-line path was modified to skirt populated areas
and to minimize the number of stream crossings by traveling along
drainage divides whenever possible. Between Wood River and Patoka, the
Direct Alternative follows the same alignment as Keystone's proposed
route. Between Wood River and Cushing, the Direct Alternative roughly
parallels Enbridge's Ozark pipeline corridor, but collocation was
not assumed.

A reconnaissance-level GIS analysis and comparison of the Direct
Alternative and Keystone's Proposed Route was performed (see Table
4.3-1). Based on this analysis, there is no clear environmental
advantage associated with the Direct Alternative. The pipeline miles
are very close, as are the approximate number of acres required for the
pipeline ROW (acres required for ancillary facilities, access roads,
work pads, etc. were not included in this assessment). The Direct
Alternative would require an additional 48 water body crossings,
and may require additional pump stations. It does not take advantage
of collocation with other pipeline corridors. While slightly fewer
miles of wetlands (based on available wetlands inventory mapping)
and federal lands (based on available GIS coverage) may be crossed
by the Direct Alternative, in a general sense this alternative would
likely lead to more environmental impact than would construction of
the Proposed Route.

**ES.5.4 Route Variations for the Proposed Route Alternative**

As part of the route development and selection process, numerous route
variations to the initially planned Mainline Project route and Cushing
Extension route have been incorporated into the proposed route. These
variations were developed based on discussions with landowners,
resource stewards, and project engineers to avoid or minimize impacts
to natural or cultural resources, reduce or eliminate engineering
and constructability concerns, and avoid or minimize conflicts with
existing or proposed residential and agricultural land uses.

In addition to the route variations described, the scoping process
identified public concerns related to route location. Many of these
comments addressed specific route variations related to avoiding
shelterbelts and aesthetic features, such as bike paths and parks. The
Scoping Report is provided as Appendix A for reference. Specific Route
Alternatives in the vicinity of Seward Nebraska, Fordville North
Dakota, and in the Hecla Sandhills Region were analyzed in detail
based on public and agency comments. Aspects of two of the variations,
the Seward Route Alternative and the Hecla Sandhills Route Alternative
were incorporated into the proposed route for the Keystone Project. The
final design alignment, where feasible, considers these minor route
variations and attempts to address additional landowner requirements,
such as crossing property along quarter section lines. Additional minor
alignment shifts would be required prior to and during construction
to accommodate unforeseeable site- specific constraints related to
other engineering, landowner, and environmental concerns.

**ES.5.5 Aboveground Facility Alternatives for the Proposed Route**

Pump stations, valve sites, temporary worksites, and pipe and
contractor yards are identified in the EIS for the Keystone
Project. The proposed project includes 24 pump stations, 44 pipe
storage yards, 36 contractor yards, and 57 main line valves (MLVs)
along the Mainline Project and 3 pump stations, 10 pipe storage yards,
6 contractor yards, and 15 MLVs along the Cushing Extension. Although
the preferred locations for these facilities were chosen based on
Project need, the proximity of public access, habitats, dwellings,
and other land and ROW issues also were considered in siting the
facilities. Over the course of Project development, pump station
locations have been relocated due to environmental, engineering or
landowner concerns.
