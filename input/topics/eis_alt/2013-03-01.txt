ES.6 **ALTERNATIVES**

The draft Supplemental EIS considers three broad categories
of alternatives to the proposed Project, consistent with NEPA
requirements:

• No Action Alternative---which addresses potential market responses
that could result if the Presidential Permit is denied or the proposed
Project is not otherwise implemented;

• Major Route Alternatives---which includes other potential pipeline
routes for transporting WCSB and Bakken crude oil to Steele City,
Nebraska; and

• Other Alternatives---which include minor route variations,
alternative pipeline designs, and alternative sites for aboveground
facilities.

**ES.6.1 Scenario Screening**

Several alternatives exist for the transport of WCSB and Bakken crude
oil to Gulf Coast refineries, including many that were not carried
forward for detailed analysis. The draft Supplemental EIS provides
a more detailed description of the categories of alternatives,
the alternative screening process, and the detailed alternatives
identified for evaluation in the draft Supplemental EIS.

Potential No Action Alternative scenarios were screened based on
technical and economic feasibility, such as implementation timeframe
and crude oil transport capacity, as well as the potential to
provide a cost advantage (compared to other No Action Alternative
scenarios). As explained in detail in the draft Supplemental EIS,
No Action Alternative scenarios excluded from further analysis are:

• Rail or Pipeline to Vancouver, British Columbia, and Tanker to
Gulf Coast;

• Rail Directly to Gulf Coast;

• Rail to Wood River, Illinois; Barge to Gulf Coast via Mississippi
River;

• Bitumen by Rail; and

• Canadian Pipeline Scenario (Existing Pipelines). The primary
purpose of major route alternatives is to identify a route that
avoids the NDEQ-identified Sand Hills Region without an unacceptable
increase in other environmental impacts. Although the Keystone XL
2011 Steele City Segment Alternative traverses the NDEQ-identified
Sand Hills Region, the draft Supplemental EIS evaluates the impacts
of constructing that route as a comparison against which other route
alternatives, including the proposed Project, can be made. The initial
(Phase I) screening of other major route alternatives considered the
following criteria:

• Project Purpose---to be considered reasonable, an alternative
must provide reliable transport of up to 730,000 bpd of WCSB crude
oil and up to 100,000 bpd of Bakken crude oil to Cushing, Oklahoma
(the intermediate destination of crude oil in the proposed Project) or
Gulf Coast refineries (the ultimate destination of that crude oil); and

• Pipeline Length---pipeline length was considered a relative measure
of reliability, environmental impact, and construction/operational
costs.

The Phase II screening used a desktop data review of key environmental
and other features (e.g., wetlands and waterbodies crossed, total
acreage affected). Major route alternatives excluded from further
analysis are:

• Western Alternative (to Cushing);

• Express-Platte Alternative;

• Steele City Segment-A1A Alternative;

• Keystone Corridor Option 1; and

• Keystone Corridor Option 2.

**ES.6.2 Market Analysis**

This section in the Supplemental EIS examines the changes in petroleum
markets since the publication of the Final EIS on August 26, 2011. It
assesses whether these changes alter the conclusion of the 2011 Final
EIS market analysis, namely, that the proposed Project is unlikely
to significantly affect the rate of extraction in the oil sands or in
U.S. refining activities. Specifically, the section presents changes
observed in the petroleum market since August 2011 and how such changes
may impact the assessment made in the Final EIS. The analysis is based,
in part, on the following considerations.

Several changes in the outlook for the crude oil market since August
2011 have occurred and are accounted for in the Supplemental EIS
analysis. First, the outlook for U.S. demand for transportation fuel
is now lower than it was in 2010 and 2011. Second, domestic production
of crude oil has increased and is expected to continue increasing
over the next 10 to 15 years. Third, the infrastructure for crude
oil transportation in North America, including pipeline, rail, and
other non-pipeline modes, is undergoing significant adaptations and
increases in capacity.

While the increase in U.S. production of crude oil and the reduced
U.S. demand for transportation fuels will likely reduce the demand for
total U.S. crude oil imports, it is unlikely to reduce demand for heavy
sour crude at Gulf Coast refineries. Additionally, as was projected in
the 2011 Final EIS, the midstream industry is showing it is capable
of developing alternative capacity to move WCSB (and Bakken and
Midcontinent) crudes to markets in the event the proposed Project is
not built. Specifically, it is moving to develop alternative pipeline
capacity that would support Western Canadian, Bakken, and Midcontinent
crude oil movements to the Gulf Coast and is increasingly using rail
to transport large volumes of crude oil to East, West, and Gulf Coast
markets as a viable alternative to pipelines. In addition, projected
crude oil prices are sufficient to support production of essentially
all Western Canadian crude oil projects (and U.S. tight oil projects,
such as those in the Bakken shale), even with potentially somewhat
more expensive transport options to market in the form of alternative
pipelines and rail. Rail and supporting non-pipeline modes should be
capable, as was projected in 2011, of providing the capacity needed
to transport all

incremental Western Canadian and Bakken crude oil production to
markets if there were no additional pipeline projects approved.

Approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including
the proposed Project, remains unlikely to significantly impact the
rate of extraction in the oil sands, or the continued demand for
heavy crude oil at refineries in the U.S. Limitations on pipeline
transport would force more crude oil to be transported via other
modes of transportation, such as rail, which would probably (but not
certainly) be more expensive. Longer term limitations also depend
upon whether pipeline projects that are located exclusively in Canada
proceed (such as the proposed Northern Gateway, the Trans Mountain
expansion, and the TransCanada proposal to ship crude oil east to
Ontario on a converted natural gas pipeline).

If all such pipeline capacity were restricted in the
medium-to-long-term, the incremental increase in cost of the
non-pipeline transport options could result in a decrease in production
from the oil sands, perhaps 90,000 to 210,000 bpd (approximately 2
to 4 percent) by 2030. If the proposed Project were denied but other
proposed new and expanded pipelines go forward, the incremental
decrease in production could be approximately 20,000 to 30,000 bpd
(from 0.4 to 0.6 percent of total WCSB production) by 2030.

Fundamental changes to the world crude oil market, and/or more far
reaching actions than are evaluated in this Supplemental EIS would be
required to significantly impact the rate of production in the oil
sands. In light of the additional analysis performed, as explained
in the Supplemental EIS, these changes are not anticipated to alter
the outlook for the crude oil market in a manner that would lead to
a change in the key conclusions reached in the 2011 Final EIS.

**ES.6.3 No Action Alternative**

The No Action Alternative includes an evaluation of multiple
scenarios that describe potential outcomes if the Department was
to deny the Presidential Permit for the proposed Project, or if
it was otherwise not constructed. Based on available information
and independent analysis discussed at greater length in the draft
Supplemental EIS, under a No Action "Status Quo" Alternative,
production and transportation of WCSB and Bakken crude oil would remain
unchanged. This scenario serves as a benchmark against which other
alternatives are evaluated, although market forces would preclude
this scenario from occurring.

Given that production of WCSB and Bakken crude oil will proceed with
or without the proposed Project, the denial of a Presidential Permit
would likely result in actions by other firms in the United States
(and global) petroleum market, such as use of alternative modes to
transport WCSB and Bakken crude oil. Table ES-4 compares some of
the key characteristics of the non-Status Quo scenarios under this
Alternative to the proposed Project. The individual scenarios are
described below.

**Table ES-4: Summary of No Action Alternative Scenarios**

*ES.6.3.1 Rail and Pipeline Scenario*

Under this scenario, WCSB and Bakken crude oil (in the form of dilbit
or synbit) would be shipped via railroad to Stroud, Oklahoma, where
it would be loaded into existing and expanded pipelines approximately
17 miles to Cushing, Oklahoma, where the crude oil would enter the
existing Keystone pipeline system.

This scenario would require the construction of seven new rail
loading terminals in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan (the possible loading
point for WCSB crude oil), one in Epping, North Dakota (the possible
loading point for Bakken crude oil), and seven in Stroud (see Figure
ES-12). Each new terminal would require approximately 500 acres of
land, as well as new track, pipelines, and storage tanks.

Assuming shipment via Class I (major) railroads such as the Canadian
Pacific Railway System (CPRS), Canadian National, BNSF Railway
(BNSF),and Union Pacific (UP), the distance from Lloydminster to Stroud
is approximately 1,900 to 2,000 miles. The route from Epping to Stroud
is approximately 1,350 miles. This scenario would require a total of
approximately 15 unit trains (one train with 100 rail cars) per day.

**Figure ES-12: Typical Rail Loading Facility in North Dakota**

*ES.6.3.2 Rail and Tanker Scenario*

A second transportation method would include shipping crude oil from
Alberta to a western Canada port, and then via oil tanker to Gulf
Coast markets. Under this scenario, WCSB dilbit or synbit would be
shipped via rail (CPRS or Canadian National) from Lloydminster to
Prince Rupert, British Columbia, where it would be loaded onto Suezmax
vessels (capable of carrying approximately 986,000 bbl of WCSB crude
oil) to the Gulf Coast (Houston and/or Port Arthur) via the Panama
Canal. Bakken crude would be shipped to Stroud via BNSF or UP rail
lines. Bakken crude oil would be transported by rail, as described
under the Rail and Pipeline Scenario. This scenario would require
13 unit trains (trains consisting of approximately 100 cars carrying
the same material and destined for the same location) per day between
Lloydminster and Prince Rupert, and 1 to 2 unit trains per day between
Epping and Stroud. This scenario would require the construction of
seven rail loading facilities in Lloydminster. Required facilities
in Prince Rupert would include seven unloading facilities and a new
marine terminal and storage terminal encompassing approximately 4,700
acres and capable of accommodating two Suezmax vessels. For the Bakken
crude portion of this Scenario, one rail terminal would be required
in Epping and Stroud.

**ES.6.4 Major Pipeline Route Alternatives**

The Department considered potential alternative pipeline routes
to assess whether or not route alternatives could avoid or reduce
impacts to environmentally sensitive resources while also meeting the
proposed Project's purpose. The two route alternatives evaluated in
the draft Supplemental EIS are described below. Table ES-5 summarizes
key aspects of the major pipeline route alternatives.

*ES.6.4.1 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative*

The Keystone XL 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative evaluates the
impacts of constructing the route proposed in the August 2011 Final
EIS as a comparison against which other route alternatives, including
the proposed Project, can be made. This alternative would follow
Keystone's proposed Project route from the Canadian border milepost
(MP 0) south to approximately MP 204 where it would connect with the
proposed Bakken Marketlink Project onramp at the same location as the
proposed Project, and continue to approximately MP 615 in northern
Nebraska near the South Dakota border.

At that location, the Keystone XL 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative
would divert from the current proposed Project and would continue
southeasterly for another 240 miles to the southern terminus at
Steele City, Nebraska. For approximately 90 miles, the Keystone XL
2011 Steele City Segment Alternative would cross the NDEQ-identified
Sand Hills Region.

*ES.6.4.2 I-90 Corridor Alternative*

Keystone's proposed Project route starts at the Canadian Border
(MP 0) and stretches south through the state of Montana into South
Dakota to approximately MP 516, where the proposed pipeline route
intersects Interstate 90 (I-90). From this point, this alternative
pipeline route would follow the ROW of I-90 and State Highway 262
for 157 miles, where it would then intersect and follow the ROW of
the existing Keystone pipeline to Steele City.

The I-90 Corridor would avoid crossing the NDEQ- identified Sand Hills
Region and would reduce the length of pipeline crossing the Northern
High Plains Aquifer system, which includes the Ogallala formation.

**ES.6.5 Other Alternatives Considered**

*ES.6.5.1 Route Variations*

In addition to the route alternatives, the Department reviewed proposed
variations---relatively short deviations---to the proposed route
that avoid or minimize construction impacts to specific resources
(cultural resource sites, wetlands, recreational lands, residences,
etc.) or that minimize constructability issues (shallow bedrock,
difficult waterbody crossings, steep terrain, etc.).

*ES.6.5.2 Alternative Pipeline Design*

In response to public comments, the Department considered two
alternative pipeline designs: an aboveground pipeline and an
alternative using smaller-diameter pipe. The Department determined
that both alternative designs were not reasonable alternatives for
the proposed Project; they were not considered further in the draft
Supplemental EIS.
