**ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED**

DOS considered the following three major alternative scenarios: 

• No Action Alternative -- potential scenarios that could occur if
the proposed Project is not built and operated;

• System Alternatives − the use of other pipeline systems or other
methods of providing Canadian crude oil to the Cushing tank farm and
the Gulf Coast market;

• Major Route Alternatives − other potential pipeline routes for
transporting heavy crude oil from the U.S./Canada border to Cushing,
Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast market.

**No Action Alternative**

Under the No Action Alternative, the potential adverse and positive
impacts associated with building and operating the proposed Project
would not occur. However, there is an existing market demand for heavy
crude oil in the Gulf Coast area. The demand for crude oil in the Gulf
Coast area is projected to increase and refinery runs are projected
to grow over the next 10 years, even under a low demand outlook.

A report commissioned by the Department of Energy (DOE) indicated that
whether the proposed Project is built or not is unlikely to impact
the demand for heavy crude oil by the Gulf Coast refineries. Even if
improved fuel efficiency and broader adoption of alternative fuels
reduced overall demand for oil, demand for Canadian heavy crude oil
at Gulf Coast refineries would not be substantially affected.

At the same time, three of the four countries that are major crude
oil suppliers to Gulf Coast refineries currently face declining
or uncertain production horizons. As a result, those refineries
are expected to obtain increased volumes of heavy crude oil from
alternative sources in both the near term and further into the
future. Implementation of the No Action Alternative would not meet
this need.

If the proposed Project is not built and operated, Gulf Coast
refineries could obtain Canadian crude oil transported through other
new pipelines or by rail or truck transport. Other pipeline projects
have been proposed to transport Canadian crude oil to the Gulf Coast
area, and both rail transport and barge transport could be used to
meet a portion of the need. In addition, the Gulf Coast refineries
could obtain crude oil transported by marine tanker from areas outside
of North America. Many of the sources outside of North America are in
regions that are experiencing declining production or are not secure
and reliable sources of crude oil, including the Middle East, Africa,
Mexico, and South America.

As a result of these considerations, DOS does not regard the No Action
Alternative to be preferable to the proposed Project.

If the proposed Project is not implemented, Canadian producers would
seek alternative transportation systems to move oil to markets other
than the U.S. Several projects have been proposed to transport crude
oil out of using pipelines to Canadian ports.

Whether or not the proposed Project is implemented, Canadian producers
would seek alternative transportation systems to move oil to markets
other than the U.S. Several projects have been proposed to transport
crude oil out of the oil sands area of Alberta using pipelines to
Canadian ports.

**System Alternatives**

System alternatives would use combinations of existing or expanded
pipeline systems, pipeline systems that have been proposed or
announced, and non-pipeline systems such as tank trucks, railroad
tank cars, and barges and marine tankers to transport Canadian heavy
crude oil to Gulf Coast refineries.

None of the pipeline systems considered would be capable of
transporting Canadian crude oil to Gulf Coast delivery points in the
volumes required to meet Keystone's commitments for transporting
380,000 bpd to delivery points in Texas. Therefore they would not
meet the purpose of the proposed Project. A combination of the
pipeline systems considered could, over time, deliver volumes of
Canadian oil sands crude oil in volumes similar to the volumes that
would be transported by the proposed Project. However, that would
not meet the near-term need for heavy crude oil at the Gulf Coast
refineries. Expanding the pipeline systems that were considered to meet
the purpose of the proposed Project or construction of new components
or a combination of those systems would result in impacts similar to
those of the proposed Project.

The trucking alternative would add substantial congestion to highways
in all states along the route selected, particularly at and near the
border crossing and in the vicinity of the delivery points. At those
locations it is likely that there would be significant impacts to
the existing transportation systems. Trucking would also result in
substantially higher greenhouse gas emissions and a higher risk of
accidents than transport by pipeline. 

Development of a rail system to transport the volume of crude oil that
would be transported by the proposed Project would likely produce less
impact from construction than would the proposed Project because it
could be done using existing tracks. However, there would be greater
safety concerns and greater impacts during operation, including
higher energy use and greenhouse emissions, greater noise impacts,
and greater direct and indirect effects on many more communities than
the proposed Project.

As a result of these considerations as described in Section 4.2 of
the EIS, system alternatives were considered either not reasonable
or not environmentally preferable.

**Major Route Alternatives**

The analysis of route alternatives considered 14 major
route alternatives. Figure ES-8 depicts the alternative routes
considered. The analysis of alternatives routes was conducted following
the approach to assessments of alternative pipeline routes used by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As a result, the analysis
began with a screening process that first established criteria for
screening alternatives, then identified potential alternatives that met
the criteria, and determined whether or not they would (1) meet the
purpose of and need for the proposed Project, and (2) be technically
and economically practicable or feasible. For those alternatives
meeting the criteria, DOS assessed whether or not the alternative
offered an overall environmental advantage over the proposed route.

Due to public concern regarding the Ogallala Aquifer (Northern High
Plains Aquifer system) and the Sand Hills region, 5 of the alternative
routes were developed to either minimize the pipeline length over those
areas or avoid the areas entirely. These alternative routes consisted
of I-90 Corridor Alternatives A and B, Keystone Corridor Alternatives
1 and 2 (which are parallel to all or part of the route of the existing
Keystone Oil Pipeline System), and the Western Alternative.

The assessment considered the environmental characteristics of the
areas that these alternatives would cross, including the presence
of aquifers, the depth of wells, developed land, forested areas,
wetlands, and streams and rivers.

The Western Alternative was eliminated since it was financially
impracticable. Although the other four route alternatives could have
been eliminated based on consideration of economical and technical
practicability and feasibility without further evaluation, they
were nonetheless examined further with an emphasis on groundwater
resources. The I-90 Corridor and Keystone Corridor alternatives would
all avoid the Sand Hills; however, they would not avoid the Northern
High Plains Aquifer system, and they would not avoid areas of shallow
groundwater. Instead, these routes would shift risks to other areas
of the Northern High Plains Aquifer system and to other aquifers.

In addition, these alternatives would be longer than the proposed
route and would disturb more land and cross more water bodies than
the proposed route. In addition, I-90 Corridor Alternatives A and B
require crossing Lake Francis Case on the Missouri River which would
pose technical challenges due to the width of the reservoir and the
slope of the western side of the crossing area.

Keystone Corridor Alternatives 1 and 2 would cost about 25 percent more
than the proposed Project (about $1.7 billion more) and implementation
of either of those alternatives would compromise the Bakken Marketlink
Project and the opportunity to transport crude oil from the producers
in the Bakken formation to markets in Cushing and the Gulf Coast.

Based on the above considerations and as described in Section 4.3 of
the EIS, DOS eliminated the major potential route alternatives from
further consideration.

**Route Variations and Minor Realignments**

A route variation is a relatively short deviation from a proposed route
that replaces a segment of the proposed route. Variations are developed
to resolve landowner concerns and impacts to cultural resource sites,
wetlands, recreational lands, and terrain.

DOS consulted with the Bureau of Land Management and state agencies to
negotiate route variations and minor realignments, including nearly 100
in Montana and about 240 minor realignments in other states along the
proposed route. Additional route variations and minor realignments may
be added in response to specific conditions that may arise throughout
the construction process. 

**Figure ES-8 Major Route Alternatives** 

The variations and minor realignments would replace short segments
of the proposed Project, are relatively close to the proposed route,
and would be implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirements of federal, state, or local permitting agencies. DOS
considers the variations and minor realignments selected to have been
evaluated sufficiently to meet the environmental review requirements
of the National Environmental Protection Act.

**Other Alternatives Considered**

DOS also considered several other scenarios in response to comments on
the draft EIS. The alternative pipeline designs considered consisted
of an aboveground pipeline and a smaller diameter pipe to decrease the
volume of oil released from a spill. DOS also considered alternative
sites for the major aboveground facilities of the proposed Project,
including pump stations, mainline valves, and the Cushing tank
farm. None of the alternative designs or facility locations were
considered safer or environmentally preferable to the proposed
Project design.

**Agency Preferred Alternative**

DOS did not find any of the major alternatives to be preferable
to the proposed Project for the reasons presented in the final EIS
and summarized above. As a result, the agency-preferred alternative
is the proposed Project route with the variations and minor route
realignments described in the EIS, and the proposed location of the
Cushing tank farm.
