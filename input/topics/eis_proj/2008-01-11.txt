**ES.2 PROPOSED ACTION -- DOS PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE**

Keystone proposes to construct and operate a crude oil pipeline and
related facilities to transport Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
(WCSB) crude oil from an oil supply hub near Hardisty, Alberta,
Canada to destinations in the Midwest United States. In total, the
Keystone Project would consist of the Mainline Project (approximately
1,849 miles of pipeline, including about 767 miles in Canada and 1,082
miles in the United States) and the Cushing Extension (296 miles of
pipeline in the United States). Including the Cushing Extension, the
total length of pipeline in the United States would be 1,380 miles. The
Keystone Project initially would have the nominal transport capacity of
435,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from the oil supply hub near
Hardisty to an existing terminal and refinery at Wood River, Illinois,
and an existing terminal at Patoka, Illinois. Additional pumping
capacity could be added to increase the average throughput to 591,000
bpd if warranted by future shipper demand and market conditions.

In the United States, the proposed Mainline Project comprises 1,082
miles of new 30-inch-diameter pipe from the Canada/U.S. border to
Patoka, Illinois. The Cushing Extension would consist of 296 miles of
36-inch-diameter pipe extending from Steele City, Nebraska to Cushing,
Oklahoma. This EIS describes and evaluates the U.S. portion of the
proposed Keystone Project, including both the Mainline Project and
Cushing Extension.

The objective of the Proposed Route was to meet the original Project
objective of delivering crude oil to Wood River and Patoka, Illinois
as well as delivering oil to Cushing, Oklahoma. To accomplish the
objective of delivering crude oil to Wood River and Patoka, and
eventually to Cushing, the Proposed Route follows the shortest route
possible between the Canadian border and Cushing. The route crosses
the U.S./Canada border at Pembina County North Dakota, and follows
a southerly track through North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska
(see Figure 2.1-1). At Steele City on the Nebraska/ Kansas border,
the Mainline Project of the Proposed Route turns east through the
northeast corner of Kansas and crosses Missouri to terminals at Wood
River and Patoka, Illinois. The Cushing Extension continues south from
Steele City through Kansas to Ponca City and Cushing, Oklahoma. This
route would facilitate access to Cushing while preserving access
to the original markets in Illinois, and would provide collocation
opportunities along the existing Platte pipeline.

The length of pipeline proposed within each affected state is listed
in Table ES-1.

Keystone would construct the 30- and 36-inch-diameter pipelines within
a 110-foot-wide corridor, consisting of a temporary 60-foot-wide
construction right-of-way (ROW) and a 50-foot-wide permanent ROW.

Ownership of lands that would be crossed by the proposed Keystone
Project is identified in Table ES-2.
