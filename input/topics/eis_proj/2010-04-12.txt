**ES.2.1 Pipeline System**

The Project includes three new pipeline segments plus additional
pumping capacity on the previously permitted Cushing Extension Segment
of the Keystone Pipeline Project (Keystone Cushing Extension):

• Steele City Segment (from Morgan, Montana to Steele City, Nebraska)
that connects to the northern end of the previously approved, and
currently under construction, Keystone Cushing

• Gulf Coast Segment (from Cushing, Oklahoma to Nederland, Texas)
that connects to the southern end of the Keystone Cushing Extension;
and

• Houston Lateral (from the Gulf Coast Segment, in Liberty County,
Texas to Moore Junction, in

Harris County, Texas).

Table ES.2.1-1 lists the miles of new pipeline by state for the
proposed Keystone XL Project.

The Project components would include 30 new pump stations, 74 mainline
valves (MLVs), approximately

50 permanent access roads, one tank farm, and two crude oil delivery
sites. Additional access roads,

stockpile sites, railroad sidings and construction camps would be
required during Project construction.

The pipeline would require a 110-foot wide construction right-of-way
(ROW), consisting of a 60-foot temporary easement and a 50-foot
permanent easement. In certain sensitive areas, which may include
wetlands, cultural sites, shelterbelts, residential areas, or
commercial/industrial areas, the construction

ROW would be reduced to 85 feet.

**ES.2.2 Connected Actions**

Pump stations, remotely operated valves and densitometers1 for
the Project would be electrically powered. The necessary electric
power lines and associated facility upgrades would be constructed
by local electrical service companies to provide power for these
facilities. Those companies would be responsible for obtaining the
necessary approvals or authorizations from federal, state, and local
agencies for such facilities. Although the permitting process for
the electrical facilities is an independent process,

construction and operation of these facilities are considered connected
actions under NEPA and were evaluated as part of the NEPA review
process reported in this EIS. Additionally, Western has determined
that due to load forecasts associated with proposed pump stations in
South Dakota, a new 230-kV

transmission line would need to be added to the existing electrical
grid system; as a result Western has proposed construction and
operation of the 80-mile-long Lower Brule to Witten transmission
line. Two potential corridors and several route options within each
of those corridors were identified for the transmission line; the
potential impacts of construction and operation of the transmission
line are generally addressed in this EIS. An additional and separate
NEPA environmental assessment of the alternatives for the proposed
transmission line will be conducted in the future.
