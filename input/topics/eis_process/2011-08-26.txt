**INTRODUCTION**

In September 2008, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP (Keystone) filed
an application for a Presidential Permit with the U.S. Department of
State (DOS) to build and operate the Keystone XL Project. The proposed
Project would have the capacity to transport 700,000 barrels per day
(bpd) of crude oil to delivery points in Oklahoma and southeastern
Texas.

This Executive Summary of the final environmental impact statement
(final EIS) summarizes the proposed Project, including the purpose
of and need for the Project, and the major conclusions and areas of
concern raised by agencies and the public. More detailed information
on the proposed Project, alternatives to the proposed Project, and
the associated potential environmental impacts is presented in the
final EIS that is provided in the CD in the sleeve on the back page.

**PRESIDENTIAL PERMITTING PROCESS**

All facilities which cross the international borders of the United
States require a Presidential Permit. For liquid hydrocarbon pipelines,
the President, through Executive Order 13337, directs the Secretary of
State to decide whether a project is in the national interest before
granting a Presidential Permit.

As part of the Presidential Permit review process, DOS determined that
it should prepare an EIS consistent with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). DOS is the lead federal agency for the NEPA
environmental review of the Proposed Project because the need for a
Presidential Permit is the most substantial federal decision related to
the Proposed Project. To assist in preparing the EIS, DOS retained an
environmental consulting firm, Cardno ENTRIX, following DOS guidelines
on third- party contracts. The DOS environmental and safety review
of the proposed Project that lead to the final EIS was conducted
for nearly 3 years and included consultations with the third-party
contractor, cooperating agencies, and scientists and engineers with
expertise in key areas of concern related to the proposed Project.

The determination of national interest involves consideration of
many factors, including energy security; environmental, cultural,
and economic impacts; foreign policy; and compliance with relevant
federal regulations. Before making a decision, DOS will consult with
the eight federal agencies identified in Executive Order 13337: the
Departments of Energy, Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security,
Justice, Interior, and Commerce, and the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). DOS will also solicit public input on the national
interest determination by accepting written comments and holding
comment meetings in the six states traversed by the proposed route
and in Washington, D.C.

Figure ES-1 lists the major events, public outreach activities,
and other details of the environmental review and national interest
determination processes.
