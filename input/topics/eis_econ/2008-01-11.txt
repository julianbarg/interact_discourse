**ES.3 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED ACTION**

The primary purpose of the proposed pipeline is to transport crude
oil from the WCSB across the border to meet the growing demand by
refineries and markets in the United States. The need for the Project
is dictated by:

• Increasing WCSB heavy crude oil supply and uncertain availability
of oil from world supplies;

• U.S. demand for crude oil, particularly in the Midwest and Gulf
States supported by the Keystone Mainline and Cushing Extension; and

• Pipeline capacity available to ship WCSB crude oil.

**ES.3.1 Increasing Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin Crude Oil
Supply**

According to Oil and Gas Journal*,* Canada has 179 billion barrels
of proven oil reserves, with 174 billion of those reserves in oil
sands located in the WCSB. The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
also estimates that 174 billion barrels of proven reserves are
recoverable from Canada's oil sands. The province of Alberta is now
widely accepted as having the second largest reserves in the world,
second only to Saudi Arabia.

Crude oil production from the entire WCSB, including oil sands and
conventional production, is now at 2.3 million bpd. According to
CNEB, conventional crude oil production in the WCSB is expected to
decline but because of rapidly growing oil sands production total
WCSB production will rise to 3.9 million bpd by 2015.

**ES.3.2 Uncertainty of World Oil Supplies**

Global oil production capacity and consumption remain tightly balanced
after 4 years of rapid demand growth in Asia, the United States,
and the Middle East. DOS and industry analysts project that it will
remain so into the medium term. The ability and willingness of major
oil and gas producers to step up investment in order to meet rising
global demand are particularly uncertain. Political instability in
several of the United States' top 11 suppliers is also expected to
increase demand for crude oil from Canada. Canada's expected production
increases, coupled with the adverse factors affecting other major
U.S. suppliers make it likely that an ever larger share of U.S. oil
imports will be sourced from this stable and nearby supplier. Even if
the share of total imported oil in overall U.S. demand remains the
same or declines slightly in coming years, as expected, DOS expects
that heavy oil imports from the WCSB will continue to increase.

**ES.3.3 U.S. Crude Oil Market Demand**

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA),
U.S. consumption of liquid fuels (crude oil and refined products)
is projected to total 26.9 million bpd in 2030, an increase of 6.2
million bpd over the 2005 total. Most of this increased demand is
expected to be met with crude oil imports. Canada has traditionally
been the United State's largest supplier of oil due to its reliability
and proximity to U.S. markets. Canada's share of U.S. oil imports has
risen from 15 to 16 percent over the last 10 years, while the whole
of the Western Hemisphere now accounts for 41 percent of U.S. oil
imports. Demand for the proportion of heavy to light crude used by
U.S. refiners has increased over the last 20 years as world supplies
of light crude have diminished in proportion to supplies of heavy
and extra-heavy crude. Many U.S. refiners have completed or are in
the process of completing retrofits to handle the heavier types of
crude in response to this change in the world supply. In recent years,
crude oil imports from Venezuela (most of which are of heavy grade)
have declined. The heavy crude oil that Keystone will deliver to
U.S. refiners is ideally suited to replace the loss of these types
of crude and meet the expected increase in demand.

**ES.3.4 Mainline Project and Cushing Extension Demand**

In December 2005, Keystone provided shippers an opportunity to
participate in the Keystone Project by entering into contractual
commitments for pipeline capacity. Shippers committed to binding
contracts for 340,000 bpd. These binding commitments demonstrate
the need for incremental pipeline capacity and access to Canadian
crude supplies, and represent a commitment to utilize the Keystone
Project. Keystone expects that the remainder of the excess capacity
will be utilized by non-contract shippers at the tariff rate
approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) (ENSR
2006a). Potential shippers also have expressed strong interest in a
proposed pipeline extension to the Cushing market area. TransCanada
conducted an Open Season process for the Mainline Project which ran
from November 4 to December 1, 2005. As a result of the Open Season,
TransCanada has secured firm, long-term contracts totaling 340,000
bpd, with an average duration of 18 years. Keystone anticipates that
existing contracts will be renewed and additional contracts will be
entered into such that the average contract term will continue beyond
18 years. This reasoning is based on the amount of crude oil reserves
in the WCSB and the expected increase in production from the oil sands
(TransCanada 2007c). A binding Open Season for the Cushing Extension
closed at noon on March 14, 2007 (ENSR 2006a).

**ES.3.5 Pipeline Capacity from the Western Canadian Sedimentary
Basin**

Nearly all of the 1.9 million bpd of crude oil imported from Canada
in 2006 came from the WCSB, and all of that was transported through
three major pipeline systems: Enbridge, Kinder Morgan Express, and
Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain. Total capacity from the WCSB for crude
oil to U.S. markets now stands

at 2.4 million bpd. However, the majority of WCSB crude continues to be
sold into the U.S. Midwest where a large proportion of U.S. refining
capacity is located, and an increasing amount is forwarded on
to refiners in the U.S. Gulf Coast to offset declines in offshore
production. These two districts are directly and indirectly served by
the Enbridge system and Kinder Morgan Express, which together have
a capacity of 2.1 million bpd. Total capacity for heavy oil on the
Enbridge and Kinder Morgan Express systems now stands at 1.2 million
bpd. In 2006, approximately 1 million bpd of heavy crude was exported
from the WCSB to the United States via these two pipelines.

Even with modifications to existing systems and de-bottlenecking
efforts that are underway by Enbridge, it is likely that crude oil
exports from the WCSB to the United States will exceed available
pipeline capacity in 2009, necessitating the construction of a new
pipeline to facilitate continued importation of crude oil.

Exactly how much more capacity will be needed in the short term to
mid term can be estimated. Given CNEB projections of an additional
1.6 million bpd of WCSB production over the current level by 2015,
expected increased U.S. demand, and a similar proportion continued to
be consumed by Canada (30 percent), an additional 1.1 million bpd of
pipeline capacity would be needed by 2015 to accommodate U.S. crude
oil imports from the WCSB. This increase in capacity would justify
construction of Keystone's planned 450,000-bpd pipeline, and would
necessitate additional pipeline construction to meet the remaining
700,000 bpd of capacity.
