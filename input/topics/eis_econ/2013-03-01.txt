**ES.2.1 Purpose and Need**

The Department must determine if the proposed Project is in the
national interest pursuant to Executive Order 13337. The Department
evaluates the proposed Project's purpose and need consistent with
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

According to the application submitted by Keystone, the primary purpose
of the proposed Project is to provide the infrastructure to transport
heavy crude oil from the border with Canada to delivery points in
the United States by connecting to existing pipeline facilities near
Steele City, Nebraska. The proposed Project is meant to respond to
the market demand of refineries for heavy crude oil. The proposed
Project would also provide transportation for light crude oil from
the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana (as well as from Canada).

The proposed Project would have the capacity to deliver up to
830,000 bpd. Keystone has represented that it has firm commitments to
transport approximately 555,000 bpd of heavy crude oil from producers
in the WCSB. In addition, Keystone has represented that it has firm
commitments to transport 65,000 bpd of crude oil from the Bakken of
the 100,000 bpd of capacity set aside on the proposed Project for that
purpose. The ultimate mixture and quantity of crude oils transported
by the proposed Project over its lifetime would be determined by
future market forces.

**ES.2.2 Crude Oil Overview**

Oil producers send a variety of crude oils to refiners to produce
consumer products such as gasoline, diesel fuel for trucks, heating
oil, and raw materials for plastics and medicines. Each U.S. refinery
has different "hardware"--- equipment and capacity, metallurgy,
and treating processes---and different resulting mixes of finished
products.

The proposed Project would primarily transport crude oil from the
WCSB and Bakken regions. The majority of the oil from WCSB sources is
considered a heavy crude oil, while Bakken crude is considered a light
crude oil. In general, refineries in the Gulf Coast area are designed
to process a mixture of heavy and light crudes. The refineries in
that region possess one of the highest concentrations of heavy-crude
refining capacity of any area in the world. Gulf Coast refiners use
both domestic crude oil produced in the United States, and crude oil
imported from foreign countries to create various petroleum products.

The crude oil from the WCSB is produced as a viscous material, known
as raw bitumen, that has the consistency of soft asphalt. Due to its
viscosity, bitumen cannot be transported by pipeline on its own. It
first must be mixed with a petroleum-based product (called a diluent),
such as naphtha or natural gas condensate, to make a less viscous
liquid called dilbit; or it must be upgraded (partially refined) to
a medium weight crude oil called "synthetic crude oil." If diluents
are not available, producers use synthetic crude oil as the diluent
to create a product called synbit. The proposed Project is expected
to carry predominantly either dilbit, synbit, or both, as well as
synthetic crude oil and light crude oil produced from the Bakken.

**ES.2.3 Market Overview**

Refiners determine the optimal crudes to process similar to other
manufacturing companies that select the right raw materials to
manufacture products. Refining companies pay market prices for crude
oil, and measure their profitability based on selling their product
into the wholesale market. They then use that margin (the difference
between the price of crude and the price of the refined products)
to cover their expenses and generate profits. Refiners may select a
more expensive crude oil if that crude oil's yield provides a greater
margin than a cheaper crude oil.

The proposed Project seeks to capitalize on the demands of refiners
for a stable supply of both heavy and light crude oil. Refineries
in the Gulf Coast rely mostly on foreign imports, particularly from
Venezuela and Mexico, as well as from other countries. However,
the volume of crude exports from Mexico is declining. The long-term
contracts supporting the proposed Project indicate that refiners see
economic advantages to processing heavy WCSB crude oil as well as the
domestically produced Bakken light crude oil, which are both growing
in supply and may be less expensive to transport to the refinery than
imported crude oils that are shipped by tanker. A detailed analysis
of the market is presented in the Supplemental EIS and discussed
further in the Market Analysis section of this Executive Summary.
