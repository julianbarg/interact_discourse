**3.0 Demand for Facility**

The purpose of the Project is to transport crude oil production
from the WCSB to meet growing demand by refineries and markets in
the US. The Project will transport crude oil from the oil supply hub
near Hardisty, Alberta, Canada and deliver it to existing oil storage
terminal facilities near Nederland and Houston, Texas. Construction
of the Project will provide US refineries and markets with access
to a substantial and reliable supply of Canadian crude oil to meet
increasing US demand for petroleum products.

The need for the Project is dictated by a number of factors including:

• Increasing crude oil demand in the US;

• Decreasing domestic crude oil supply in the US;

• Increasing WCSB crude oil supply;

• An opportunity to reduce US dependence on foreign offshore oil
supply through further supply diversification to stable, secure
Canadian crude supplies; and

• Binding shipper interest in the Project.

Delay or termination of the Project would delay or negate the positive
economic impacts on the local and state economy identified in Chapter
6.0, including the significant local labor and services required for
the pipeline and facilities construction, economic benefits to local
commercial sectors, as well as local and state taxes. In addition,
binding contracts have been executed for transportation on the Project,
which demonstrate the need for additional pipeline capacity to deliver
Canadian crude oil to US refineries. Delay or termination of the
construction of the Project would prevent the Project from meeting
the demand for additional capacity in the timeframe identified by
Keystone shippers through these binding contracts.

**3.1 Increasing WCSB Crude Oil Supply**

Established crude oil reserves in the WCSB are estimated at 179 billion
barrels (Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP 2008a). The
primary source of WCSB crude oil supply -- over 97 percent -- is
comprised of Canada's vast oil sands reserves located in northern
Alberta. The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board estimates there are
175 billion barrels of established reserves out of 315 billion barrels
of bitumen ultimately recoverable in Canada's oil sands. Alberta has
the second largest crude oil reserves in the world, second only to
Saudi Arabia.

As a result of growing production from the oil sands, crude oil
supplies from the WCSB are expected to increase by about 1.6 million
bpd by 2017, from current production of about 2.4 million bpd
(CAPP 2008b).

**3.2 Increasing Crude Oil Demand in the US**

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), US demand
for petroleum products has increased by over 11 percent or 2 million
bpd over the past 10 years and is expected to increase further (EIA
2007). The EIA estimates that total US petroleum consumption is
projected to increase

23 March 2009 South Dakota PUC Application by approximately 1.0
million bpd over the next 10 years (EIA 2008), representing average
demand growth of about 100,000 bpd per year.

The Project's key delivery area, PADD III on the US Gulf Coast,
represents the largest and most complex refining district in the US
with 56 refineries comprising approximately 8.4 million bpd of total
refining capacity.

**3.3 Decreasing Domestic Crude Oil Supply**

At the same time that domestic demand increases, domestic US crude
supplies continue to decline. For example, over the past 10 years,
domestic crude production in the US has declined at an average rate
of about 135,000 bpd per year or 2 percent per year (EIA 2007).

**3.4 Further Supply Diversification to Canadian Crude Oil**

The US historically has compensated for decreases in domestic
production through increased imports from Canada and foreign offshore
sources. US imports of foreign crude and refined products continue to
increase as a result of decreasing domestic production and increasing
demand. Crude and refined petroleum product imports into the US have
increased by over 3.3 million bpd over the past 10 years. In 2007,
the US imported over 13.4 million bpd of crude oil and petroleum
products or over 60 percent of total US petroleum product consumption
(EIA 2007).

Canada is currently the largest supplier of imported crude oil and
refined products to the US, supplying over 2.4 million bpd in 2007,
representing over 11 percent of total US petroleum product consumption
(EIA 2007).

The Project would provide an opportunity for US refiners in PADD III to
further diversify supply away from traditional offshore foreign crude
supply and to obtain direct access to secure and growing Canadian
crude supplies. Access to incremental Canadian crude supply also
would provide an opportunity for the US to offset annual declines in
domestic crude production and, specifically, to decrease its dependence
on other foreign crude oil suppliers, such as Mexico and Venezuela,
the top two heavy crude oil exporters into the US Gulf Coast.

**3.5 Binding Shipper Interest**

Shippers -- producers, marketers, or refiners -- evaluate the merits
of various pipeline proposals and ultimately decide which projects
to support. Shippers have expressed material interest in the Project
and in securing additional crude oil pipeline capacity. Shippers have
already committed to long-term binding contracts, enabling Keystone
to proceed with regulatory applications and construction of the
pipeline once all regulatory, environmental, and other approvals are
received. These long-term binding shipper commitments demonstrate
a material endorsement of support for the Project, its economics,
proposed route, and target market, as well as the need for additional
pipeline capacity and access to Canadian crude supplies.
