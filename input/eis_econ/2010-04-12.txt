**ES.3 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED ACTION**

The primary purpose of the proposed Project is to transport Western
Canadian Sedimentary Basin

(WCSB) crude oil from the border with Canada to existing delivery
points in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) III2
that provide connections to existing refineries in PADD III. An
additional purpose of the Project is to supplement WCSB deliveries
to the Cushing Oil Terminal in

Cushing, Oklahoma, which is in PADD II3. Keystone's goal is to
initially transport up to 700,000 bpd of crude oil by pipeline from
the WCSB to the United States. Up to 500,000 bpd of this volume
of crude oil would be transported to delivery points in PADD III
and up to 200,000 bpd would be transported to the existing Cushing
Oil Terminal. At maximum capacity (achieved with the addition of
supplementary pumping power) the Project would have the potential
to transport a total of 900,000 bpd of WCSB crude oil to the U.S.,
with the additional 200,000 bpd transported to delivery points in
PADD III. Due to market projections of future fuel demand in PADD
III, the applicant does not currently anticipate the need to expand
capacity to 900,000 bpd in the near future.

The need for the Project is dictated by:

• Supply of heavy crude oil from the WCSB;

• Demand for heavy crude oil in PADD III;

• Transport of crude oil from the WCSB to PADD III; and

• Future crude oil supply and demand scenarios with and without
the proposed Project.
