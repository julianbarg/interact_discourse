**ES.5.0 ALTERNATIVES**

Detailed analysis was conducted on three broad categories of
alternatives to the proposed Project, consistent with NEPA:

• No Action Alternative---which addresses potential market responses
that could result if the Presidential Permit is denied or the proposed
Project is not otherwise implemented;

• Major Route Alternatives---which includes other potential pipeline
routes for transporting WCSB and Bakken crude oil to Steele City,
Nebraska; and

• Other Alternatives---which include minor route variations,
alternative pipeline designs, and alternative sites for aboveground
facilities.

Several alternatives exist for the transport of WCSB and Bakken
crude oil to Gulf Coast refineries, including many that were
not carried forward for detailed analysis. This Supplemental EIS
provides a detailed description of the categories of alternatives,
the alternative screening process, and the detailed alternatives
identified for further evaluation.

**ES.5.1 No Action Alternative**

The No Action Alternative analysis considers what would likely
happen if the Presidential Permit is denied or the proposed Project
is not otherwise implemented. It includes the Status Quo Baseline,
which serves as a benchmark against which other alternatives are
evaluated. Under the Status Quo Baseline, the proposed Project
would not be constructed and the resulting direct, indirect, and
cumulative impacts that are described in this Supplemental EIS would
not occur. The Status Quo Baseline is a snapshot of the crude oil
production and delivery systems at current levels -- in other words,
no change at all -- irrespective of likely alternative transport
scenarios to transport WCSB and Bakken crude.

The No Action Alternative includes analysis of three alternative
transport scenarios that, based on the findings of the market analysis,
are believed to meet the proposed Project's purpose (i.e., providing
WCSB and Bakken crude oil to meet refinery demand in the Gulf Coast
area) if the Presidential Permit for the proposed Project were
denied, or if the pipeline were otherwise not constructed. Under
the alternative transport scenarios, other environmental impacts
would occur in lieu of the proposed Project. This Supplemental EIS
includes analysis of various combinations of transportation modes
for oil, including truck, barge, tanker, and rail. These scenarios
are considered representative of the crude oil transport alternatives
with which the market would respond in absence of the

Keystone XL pipeline. These three alternative transport scenarios
(i.e., the Rail and Pipeline Scenario, Rail and Tanker Scenario,
and Rail Direct to the Gulf Coast Scenario) are described below and
illustrated on Figure ES-14.

**ES.5.1.1 Rail and Pipeline Scenario**

Under this scenario, WCSB and Bakken crude oil (in the form of dilbit
or synbit) would be shipped via rail from Lloydminster, Saskatchewan
(the nearest rail terminal served by two Class I rail companies),
to Stroud, Oklahoma, where it would be temporarily stored and then
transported via existing and expanded pipelines approximately 17
miles to Cushing, Oklahoma, where the crude oil would interconnect
with the interstate oil pipeline system.

This scenario would require the construction of two new or expanded
rail loading terminals in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan (the possible
loading point for WCSB crude oil), one new terminal in Epping, North
Dakota (the representative loading point for Bakken crude oil),
seven new terminals in Stroud, and up to 14 unit trains (consisting
of approximately 100 cars carrying the same material and destined
for the same delivery location) per day (12 from Lloydminster and
two from Epping) to transport the equivalent volume of crude oil as
would be transported by the proposed Project.

**ES.5.1.2 Rail and Tanker Scenario**

The second transportation scenario assumes crude oil (as dilbit or
synbit) would be transported by rail from Lloydminster to a western
Canada port (assumed to be Prince Rupert, British Columbia), where it
would be loaded onto Suezmax tankers (capable of carrying approximately
986,000 barrels of WCSB crude oil) for transport to the U.S. Gulf Coast
(Houston and/or Port Arthur) via the Panama Canal. Bakken crude would
be shipped from Epping to Stroud via BNSF Railway or Union Pacific
rail lines, similar to the method described under the Rail and
Pipeline Scenario. This scenario would require up to 12 unit trains
per day between Lloydminster and Prince Rupert, and up to two unit
trains per day between Epping and Stroud. This scenario would require
the construction of two new or expanded rail loading facilities in
Lloydminster with other existing terminals in the area handling the
majority of the WCSB for shipping to Prince Rupert. Facilities in
Prince Rupert would include a new rail unloading and storage facility
and a new marine terminal encompassing approximately 4,200 acres and
capable of accommodating two Suezmax tankers. For the Bakken crude
portion of this Scenario, one new rail terminal would be necessary
in both Epping, North Dakota, and Stroud, Nebraska.

**Figure ES-14 Representative No Action Alternative Scenarios**

**ES.5.1.3 Rail Direct to the Gulf Coast**

**Scenario**

The third transportation scenario assumes that WCSB and Bakken
crude oil (as dilbit) would be shipped by rail from Lloydminster,
Saskatchewan, and Epping, North Dakota, directly to existing rail
facilities in the Gulf Coast region capable of off-loading up to
14 unit trains per day. These existing facilities would then either
ship the crude oil by pipeline or barge the short distance to nearby
refineries. It would largely rely on existing rail terminals in
Lloydminster, but would likely require construction of up to two new
or expanded terminals to accommodate the additional WCSB shipments out
of Canada. One new rail loading terminal would be needed in Epping
to ship Bakken crude oil. Sufficient off-loading rail facilities
currently exist or are proposed in the Gulf Coast area such that no
new terminals would need to be built under this scenario.

**ES.5.2 Major Pipeline Route Alternatives**

The Department considered potential alternative pipeline routes
to assess whether or not route alternatives could avoid or reduce
impacts to environmentally sensitive resources while also meeting the
proposed Project's purpose. Consistent with NEPA, a two-phase screening
process was used to evaluate prospective alternatives using a set of
criteria to determine their technical, environmental, and economic
viability. Alternatives that failed to meet the screening criteria
were not brought forward for detailed analysis in this Supplemental
EIS. The initial (Phase I) screening of other major route alternatives
considered the following criteria:

• Meeting the proposed Project's purpose and need, including whether
the alternative would require additional infrastructure such as a
pipeline to access Bakken crude oil;

• Availability;

• Reliability;

• Length within the United States;

• Total length of the pipeline, including both the United States
and Canada;

• Estimated number of aboveground facilities;

• Length co-located within an existing corridor;

• Acres of land directly affected during construction; and

• Acres of land directly affected permanently.

Pipeline length was used as an important screening criterion because
it has a relatively direct relationship with:

• System reliability, in that the longer the pipeline the greater
risk that some portion may become inoperable at some point, thereby
delaying shipments.

• Environmental impacts, including:

− Risk of spills and leaks, which represent the greatest potential
threat to water and aquatic resources;

− Temporary construction-related disturbance to natural habitat
(e.g., wetlands, forests, native prairie); and

− Permanent habitat fragmentation.

• Construction and operational costs, which generally increase in
proportion to overall pipeline length.

All other factors being equal, longer pipelines are less desirable
because they represent greater risks to system reliability,
environmental impacts, and project costs.

As a result of this Phase I screening process, the following
alternatives were eliminated because they would not meet the project
purpose and/or were significantly longer than other viable options
(see Figure ES-15):

• Western Alternative (to Cushing);

• Express Platte Alternative; and

• Existing Keystone Corridor

− Option 1: Proposed Border Crossing (near Morgan, Montana)

− Option 2: Existing Keystone Pipeline Border Crossing (at Pembina,
North Dakota).

Several commenters recommended that the proposed Project parallel
the existing Keystone Pipeline rather than the proposed route. The
Department considered these comments, but ultimately concluded that
the existing Keystone Pipeline Route was not a reasonable alternative
because it would not meet the proposed Project's purpose and need
(i.e., would not meet Keystone's contractual obligations to transport
100,000 bpd of Bakken crude oil). Further, the existing Keystone
Pipeline Corridor would be longer (taking into consideration pipeline
length in both Canada and the United States), which represents an
increased spill risk. The 2011 Steele City Segment, the I-90 Corridor,
and the Steele City Segment A1A alternatives, however, were retained
for further screening.

The Phase II screening used a desktop data review of key environmental
and other features (e.g., wetlands and waterbodies crossed, total
acreage affected). After this Phase II screening, the Steele City
Segment A1A Alternative was eliminated because this route would
be longer with an associated increased risk for spills and leaks,
would cross more miles of principal aquifer and wetlands, and would
require a second major crossing of the Missouri River, relative to the
proposed Project. For these reasons, the Steele City A1A Alternative
would not offer any offsetting environmental advantages relative
to the proposed Project to warrant further consideration. However,
both the 2011 Steele City Segment and I-90 Corridor alternatives
were considered reasonable alternatives and were retained for full
evaluation in this Supplemental EIS. These two route alternatives are
described below and depicted in Figure ES-15. Table ES-4 summarizes
key aspects of the major pipeline route alternatives.

**Figure ES-15 Preliminary Pipeline Route Alternatives**

**ES.5.2.1 Keystone XL 2011 Steele City**

**Segment Alternative**

The Keystone XL 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative evaluates the
impacts of constructing the route proposed in the 2011 Final EIS as
a comparison against which other route alternatives, including the
proposed Project, can be made. This alternative would follow Keystone's
proposed Project route from the Canadian border, designated Milepost
(MP) 0, south to approximately MP 204, where it would connect with the
Bakken Marketlink Project onramp at the same location as the proposed
Project and continue to approximately MP 615 in northern Nebraska near
the South Dakota state line. At that location, the Keystone XL 2011
Steele City Segment Alternative would divert from the current proposed
Project and would continue southeasterly for another 240 miles to the
southern terminus at Steele City, Nebraska. For approximately 89 miles,
the Keystone XL 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative would cross the
NDEQ-identified Sand Hills Region.

**ES.5.2.2 I-90 Corridor Alternative**

Keystone's proposed Project route starts at the Canadian Border
(MP 0) and stretches south through Montana and into South Dakota to
approximately MP 516, where the proposed pipeline route intersects
Interstate 90 (I-90). From this point, this alternative pipeline
route would diverge from the proposed Project route, following the
ROW of I-90 and State Highway 262 for 157 miles, where it would then
intersect and follow the ROW of the existing Keystone pipeline to
Steele City, Nebraska.

The I-90 Corridor would avoid crossing the NDEQ- identified Sand
Hills Region, and would reduce the length of pipeline crossing the
NHPAQ system, which includes the Ogallala Aquifer.

**ES.5.3 Other Alternatives Considered**

In addition to the major route alternatives, the Department reviewed
proposed variations---relatively short deviations---to the proposed
route that were designed to avoid or minimize construction impacts
to specific resources (e.g., cultural resource sites, wetlands,
recreational lands, residences) or that minimize constructability
issues (e.g., shallow bedrock, difficult waterbody crossings,
steep terrain).

The Department also considered two alternative pipeline designs in
response to public comments: an aboveground pipeline and an alternative
using a smaller-diameter pipe. The Department determined that both
alternative designs were not reasonable alternatives for the proposed
Project because they would not meet the proposed Project purpose
and need and/or because of safety and security reasons; therefore,
they were not considered further in this Supplemental EIS.

This Supplemental EIS considered renewable energy sources and energy
conservation as alternatives to the proposed Project. As noted in
Section 1.4, Market Analysis, the crude oil would be used largely for
transportation fuels and, therefore, any alternatives to the crude
oil would need to fulfill the same purpose. The analysis found that
even with renewable energy and conservation, there would still be
a demand for oil sands-derived crude oil. Based on this evaluation,
these alternatives were not carried forward for further analysis as
alternatives to the proposed Project.

**ES.5.4 Comparison of Alternatives**

Consistent with NEPA and the CEQ regulations, the Department compared
the proposed Project with the alternatives that met the proposed
Project's purpose and need, and that were carried forward for detailed
analysis in this Supplemental EIS. The alternatives carried forward
for detailed analysis were: the 2011 Steele City Segment Alternative,
the I-90 Corridor Alternative, and the three identified No Action
Alternative scenarios (i.e., the Rail and Pipeline Scenario, the Rail
and Tanker Scenario, and the Rail Direct to the Gulf Coast Scenario).

The two pipeline alternatives compare different routes that meet
the purpose and need of the proposed Project, and the No Action
Alternative scenarios describe the likely potential impacts associated
with transport of crude oil from the WCSB and the Bakken formations if
the Presidential Permit is denied or if the proposed Project is not
otherwise implemented. The comparison focuses on three categories of
impacts: physical disturbance, GHG emissions, and potential releases.

**ES.5.4.1 Physical Disturbance Impacts**

**Alternatives Comparison**

The primary differences between the proposed Project and the
alternatives related to physical disturbance are summarized in

**ES.5.4.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions**

**Alternatives Comparison**

To facilitate comparison of GHG emissions across all alternatives
for operational GHG emissions, an assessment was made for all
alternatives along the entire route from Hardisty, Alberta, to the
Gulf Coast (including pipelines in Canada and from Steele City to the
Gulf Coast). GHG emissions from the two pipeline route alternatives
would be similar in scale to those of the proposed Project. The
direct emissions during the operation phase of the 2011 Steele City
Segment Alternative would be essentially the same as those generated
by the proposed Project because they would have the same number of
pump stations (20). The I-90 Corridor Alternative is expected to have
similar but slightly higher GHG emissions because it would have one
more pump station than the proposed Project and could generate slightly
higher amounts of indirect GHG emissions from electricity consumption.

During operation of all No Action rail scenarios, the increased number
of unit trains along the scenario routes would result in GHG emissions
from both diesel fuel combustion and electricity generation to support
rail terminal operations (as well as for pump station operations for
the Rail/Pipeline Scenario). The total annual GHG emissions (direct
and indirect) attributed to the No Action scenarios range from 28 to
42 percent greater than for the proposed Project (see Table ES-6).

The indirect GHG emissions over the lifecycle of oil sands crude oil
production, transportation, refining, and product use are compared
between the proposed Project and the evaluated alternatives in Section
ES.4.1.2, Lifecycle Analysis.

**ES.5.4.3 Potential Spill Risk Alternatives**

**Comparison**

Similar to the GHG emissions comparison, potential spill risk was
evaluated for alternatives along the entire route from Hardisty,
Alberta, to the Gulf Coast (including portions of the route in
Canada and including existing pipelines from Steele City to the
Gulf Coast). Table ES-7 provides a summary of calculated potential
release impacts for the various alternatives analyzed in terms of
the number of potential releases per year and the potential volume
of oil released per year.

Both of the major route alternatives would begin at the same border
crossing as the proposed Project (near Morgan, Montana) and end at the
same location as the proposed Project (near Steele City, Nebraska);
as such, the pipelines in Canada north of the border crossing and
the pipelines south of Steele City down to the Gulf Coast would
be identical for all three overall pipeline routes. Compared to the
proposed Project, the two major pipeline route alternatives would have
similar potential spill risks (see Table ES-7). In addition, both of
these major route alternatives would require aboveground facilities
that are similar to those for the proposed Project; therefore,
potential releases impact areas would be similar. Because the I-90
Corridor Alternative is slightly longer than the proposed Project,
it would carry a slightly higher spill risk (with an estimated 533
bbl released per year compared to 518 annual bbl released for the
proposed Project).

The three No Action Alternative scenarios differ from the proposed
Project in that they would use alternative modes of transportation
to deliver crude oil to refinery markets in the Gulf Coast rather
than just a pipeline (although one of the three scenarios includes a
pipeline as a significant part of its delivery system). Potential spill
risks for these alternative modes differ from the proposed Project
in terms of both average spill frequency and average spill size.

Volume of crude oil transportation by rail in the No Action Alternative
scenarios would generally be limited to the volume contained within
individual railcars. This volume constrains the total volume of crude
oil that could potentially impact groundwater relative to the proposed
Project in the event of a release. This constraint is offset by the
increased statistical likelihood of spills associated with these
alternative modes of crude oil transport relative to pipelines.

Historical rail incident data were analyzed to evaluate potential
releases associated with rail transport in the United States. The
results help provide insight into what could potentially occur with
respect to spill volume, incident cause, and incident frequency for
the No Action Alternative scenarios that involve rail transport. In
addition, rail incident frequencies were compared to frequencies for
other modes of transport (i.e., pipeline, marine tanker). Although
the product to be transported by the proposed Project is crude oil,
incidents for petroleum products were also analyzed to provide a
comparison to a larger dataset. In order to make comparisons between
the modes of transportation, the statistics regarding releases are
expressed in terms of *ton-miles* (1 ton-mile is transporting 1 ton
of product 1 mile; to calculate total ton-miles in a given year,
one multiplies the total tons transported by the total number of
miles transported).

The rates of releases and average size of releases vary between modes
of transportation. For instance, rail transport has more reported
releases of crude oil per ton-mile than pipeline or marine transport
but, overall, pipeline transport has the highest number of barrels
released per ton-mile. Comprehensive data from 2010 to 2013 are not
yet available and therefore this analysis does not include incidents
subsequent to 2009 such as the 2013 Lac-Mégantic rail tragedy or the
Tesoro Logistics pipeline incident. The number of barrels released per
year for the No Action scenarios is higher than what is projected for
the proposed Project or the other pipeline alternatives (as detailed
in Table ES-7) because of the alternate modes of transport in the No
Action scenarios.

There is also a greater potential for injuries and fatalities
associated with rail transport relative to pipelines. Adding 830,000
bpd to the yearly transport mode volume would result in an estimated
49 additional injuries and six additional fatalities for the No Action
rail scenarios compared to one additional injury and no fatalities
for the proposed Project on an annual basis.
