**ES.5 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED**

The following alternatives were assessed by DOS:

• No Action Alternative − the proposed Project would not be built;

• System Alternatives − use of other pipeline systems or other
methods of providing crude oil supplies to the U.S. Gulf Coast market;

• Major Route Alternatives − other pipeline routes for transporting
crude oil from the U.S./Canada border near Morgan, Montana to the
Port Arthur and the east Houston areas of Texas; and

• Alternative Routes for the Electrical Transmission Line −
preliminary alternative routings for the proposed 230-kV transmission
line in South Dakota that is needed to ensure power system stability
given the loads required for providing electrical power to the pump
stations in South

In addition, MDEQ evaluated alternatives and variations in Montana
as part of its analysis of Keystone's application for a Certificate
of Compliance under the state's Major Facility Siting Act (MFSA). MDEQ

also evaluated the alternatives and variations in accordance with
the requirements of the Montana

Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) as reported in Appendix I of the EIS.

**ES.5.1 No Action Alternative**

Under the No Action Alternative, the Project would not be constructed
and would not require issuance of a DOS Presidential Permit. The
increasing demand for crude oil in the U.S. cannot be entirely met by
efforts to conserve use of refined petroleum products or the increased
use of renewable energy. As crude oil demand increases, the overall
domestic supplies of crude oil are declining. At the same time, only
a small volume of WCSB crude oil can be shipped to PADD III through a
single pipeline, and a substantial portion of the oil imported from
outside of North America originates in countries with decreasing or
undependable oil supplies. Under the No Action Alternative, it is
likely that other projects would be proposed to meet the increased
demand. Although it is not possible to identify the specific impacts
of such projects, it is likely that they would be similar in nature
to those of the proposed Project and either smaller, greater than,
or equal to the magnitude of impacts of the proposed Project.

Under the No Action Alternative, the U.S. would not receive a reliable
and cost efficient source of crude oil from the WSCB region and would
remain dependent upon unstable foreign oil supplies from the

Mideast, Africa, Mexico, and South America. Further, the WCSB crude
oil would likely be shipped to
countries outside of North America, which would require new
infrastructure that would result in environmental impacts at least as
great as those of the proposed Project. In addition, the transport
of crude oil by tanker and other means such as truck and rail would
likely result in greater GHG emissions than those that would occur as
a result of the proposed Project. Finally, the No Action Alternative
would not meet the purpose and need of the proposed Project.

**ES.5.2 System Alternatives**

System alternatives to the proposed Project would make use of
other existing, modified, or proposed pipeline systems as well as
non-pipeline systems - to meet the purpose and need of the proposed
Project.

**ES.5.2.1 Existing Pipeline Systems**

There is currently only one existing pipeline system that extends
from the Midwest to the Gulf region.

The ExxonMobil Pegasus pipeline is a system that transports crude
oil from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland,

Texas. Since the committed pipeline capacity is 50,000 bpd and the
total capacity is 66,000 bpd, Pegasus is considering an expansion of
up to 30,000 bpd to PADD III as early as 2009. Even with the proposed
expansion, the Exxon Pegasus proposal would not meet the service
capacity needs of the PADD III

**ES.5.2.2 New Pipeline System Alternatives**

Four alternative new proposed pipeline system alternatives were
analyzed: The Altex Pipeline System;

The Chinook-Maple Leaf Pipeline System; Trailbreaker Transportation
System; and the Enbridge -- BP

Delivery System all of which at this time are speculative. None of
the proposed system alternatives would provide the delivery capacity
of the proposed Project and none could provide WCSB crude oil to

PADD III in the same timeframe as the proposed Project. Therefore,
none of the system alternatives considered can meet the Project
purpose and need and none of them offer a significant environmental

**ES.5.2.3 Alternative Modes of Transportation**

Surface crude oil delivery transportation modes from the U.S./Canada
border near Morgan, Montana to the Port Arthur and the east Houston
areas of Texas were considered as an alternative to the proposed

Project. Modes considered include delivery by truck, railroad cars,
and barges. Truck transportation would not be a practical way to meet
the Project's purpose and need since crude oil transport equivalent to
that of the proposed Project would require 4,000 trucks per day. There
is not an existing direct rail line from Morgan, Montana, to Port
Arthur, Texas and the east Houston areas of Texas. Barging the oil
would not be feasible due to the lack of a large waterway system
between Morgan, Montana, and the

PADD III area capable of supporting barge traffic.

The alternative modes considered would be less safe, would require
construction of substantially more infrastructure, have greater
atmospheric emissions (including GHG), and/or pose greater safety
hazards than the proposed Project. Therefore, none of the alternative
modes of transportation have been evaluated

**ES.5.3 Pipeline Route Alternatives**

DOS identified alternatives to the proposed Project for the Steele
City Segment (SCS), the Gulf Coast

Segment (GCS), and the Houston Lateral (HL). In addition DOS considered
an alternative that would avoid using the Cushing Extension.

**ES.5.3.1 Steele City Segment Alternatives**

For the Steele City Segment, five alternatives were considered:
Express-Platte Alternative; SCS

Alternative A; SCS Alternative A1A; SCS Alternative B (the proposed
Project); and Baker Alternative.

The initial assessment of the Steele City Segment Alternatives
indicates that the alternatives considered do not offer an
environmental advantage over the Applicant's proposed route
(Alternative SCS-B), and are eliminated from further consideration.

**ES.5.3.2 Alternative to Using the Cushing Extension**

One alternative was identified that would avoid using the Cushing
Extension, the Western Alternative.

The Western Alternative does not offer an environmental advantage
over the proposed Project and was eliminated from further analysis.

**ES.5.3.3 Gulf Coast Segment Alternatives**

Two geographical alternatives were assessed for the Gulf Coast Segment:
Gulf Coast Segment (GCS)-A

(proposed Project) and GCS-B. While GSC-A would cross more wetlands
as compared to GCS-B, it would affect less overall agricultural land,
developed land, and crosses less streams/rivers. GCS-A was therefore
determined to be the environmentally preferred alternative and GCS-B
was eliminated from further analysis.

**ES.5.3.4 Houston Lateral Alternatives**

Alternatives identified for the Houston Lateral include Alternative
HL-A (the proposed Project) and

Alternative HL-B. Alternative HL-A, the environmentally preferred
alternative is the shorter route and would require fewer miles of
new pipeline and would have a lesser area of impact. Alternative HL-B

does not offer an environmental advantage over the Alternative HL-A,
and was eliminated from further

**ES.5.3.5 Summary of Pipeline Route Alternatives Analysis**

Based on the assessment of alternatives conducted, DOS determined
that none of the identified alternatives offered an environmental
advantage over the Applicant's preferred route. Therefore, the

DOS preferred route consists of the following alternatives by segment:

• Steele City Segment Alternative B (SCS-B);

• Gulf Coast Segment Alternative A (GCS-A); and

• Houston Lateral Alternative A (HL-A).

**ES.5.4 Alternative 230-kV Electrical Transmission Line Routes**

The 230-kV Lower Brule to Witten transmission line would be needed to
ensure transmission system reliability with the expected load demands
at full pipeline operational capacity in southern South Dakota.

Western and Basin Electric Power Cooperative (BEPC) have identified
two alternative transmission corridors (Alternative Corridors A and B)
for the Project and have identified five alternative routes in

Corridor A and four alternative routes in Corridor B. The corridors
extend from the Big Bend Dam and include the site of a proposed new
substation at Lower Brule and the existing Witten Substation.

The transmission line would transfer electricity from the proposed
Lower Brule Substation near Big Bend

Dam in Lyman County, to an existing substation near Witten in Tripp
County. The existing Big Bend-

Fort Thompson No. 2, 230-kV transmission line turning structure would
be converted to a double-circuit structure. Western would construct
2.1 miles of new double-circuit transmission line south of the dam and
construct the new Lower Brule Substation. The new transmission line
from the dam would connect to the Lower Brule Substation. Western
would own and operate the 2.1 mile transmission line but would
transfer ownership and operation of the Lower Brule Substation to
BEPC. BEPC would construct and operate the new, 70-mile-long, 230-kV
transmission line between the Lower Brule Substation and the existing
Witten Substation, which is owned by Rosebud Electric Cooperative. The
five alternative routes for the transmission line that were identified
within Corridor A and the four alternative routes identified within
Corridor B are all between the two substations.

Both of the alternative corridors cross the Lower Brule Reservation,
but the Corridor A has a shorter path through the Lower Brule
Reservation. The key impacts of the transmission line alternatives
are listed in the listed in EIS for comparison purposes. In addition,
the impacts of construction and operation of the transmission line
alternatives are generally addressed in Section 3.0 the EIS. However,
DOS, Western,

and the other cooperating agencies do not have sufficient design and
construction information to establish an agency preferred alternative
for the proposed transmission line project. An additional and separate

NEPA environmental review of the alternatives to the proposed
transmission line will be conducted after the alternative routes
are further defined. The design and environmental review of the
proposed 230-kV

transmission line are on a different schedule than the pipeline system
itself. Regional transmission system reliability concerns are not
associated with the initial operation of the proposed pipeline pump
stations, but rather with later stages of proposed pipeline operation
at higher levels of crude oil throughput.

**ES.5.5 Montana Major Facility Siting Act and Montana Environmental
Policy Act Environmental Review**

Keystone applied to MDEQ for a Certificate of Compliance under MFSA
for the portions of the proposed

Project in Montana. Prior to issuing a certificate, MDEQ must find and
determine the basis of the need for the facility and determine whether
or not the facility would serve the public interest, convenience,
and necessity. Under the law, it must also identify the route that
minimizes adverse environmental impacts and uses public land whenever
the use of public lands is as economically practicable as the use of
private land to include use of federal lands. As a cooperating agency
in the preparation of the EIS, MDEQ

considered and eliminated the Project alternatives described above
under the federal NEPA process.

MDEQ also required Keystone to identify and provide assessments of
two additional alternative routes in

Montana that increased the use of public lands in comparison to
Alternative SCS-B (proposed route).

Although both of the new alternatives were eliminated in the initial
screening process, portions of one of the alternatives cross more
public land as compared to the proposed route segments in those areas.

MDEQ identified those portions of the alternative as variations to
Alternative SCS-B and evaluated them along with other variations
it developed to avoid or minimize impacts to specific resources,
to minimize conflicts with existing or proposed residential and
agricultural land uses, and in response to requests submitted by
concerned landowners.

MDEQ identified and evaluated a total of 19 variations in
Montana. Descriptions of the variations and the evaluations are
presented in Appendix I along with environmental assessments of
Alternative SCS-B

in Montana that are specific to the needs of MEPA. MDEQ preliminarily
selected 9 variations as preferable to the segments of Alternative
SCS-B they would replace. DOS has determined that

Alternative SCS-B in Montana (the proposed route) and the variations
to Alternative SCS-B selected by

MDEQ have been evaluated sufficiently to meet the requirements of NEPA.
