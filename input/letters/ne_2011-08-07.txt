Head in tar sands

Again I am dismayed towards our governor in his refusal to get involved
with the Keystone XL pipeline debate. This debate has seemed to rage
on for quite some time and yet our Governor seems to be more concerned
about his image on the national stage rather than the well-being of
common, ordinary Nebraskans who want our concerns of safety issues,
land reclamation and eminent domain to be heard with regard to
the issue.

Personally, I'm not directly opposed to having a pipeline that carries
tar-sand oil across our state. Nebraska already has other pipelines
that carry oil and natural gas safely. However, I find the route
through one of the most iconic geographical land formations and over
an invaluable water source to be ill-conceived.

Yet, Gov. Dave Heineman's flat-out "no" to Sen. Ken Haar's suggestion
for a special session so thoughtful debate could occur speaks volumes
to the priorities that Heineman has. I imagine that most Nebraskans,
conservative to liberal alike, are tired of being silenced by him when
it comes the the Keystone XL. It's quite shameful that our governor
has his head stuck in the tar sands and many Nebraskans are demanding
to be heard.
