As you know, I have followed closely the ongoing State Department
review of the pending Keystone XL pipeline permit application. I have
made clear that while I oppose neither the development of the oil that
will flow in the pipeline, nor the pipeline itself, I am convinced
that the proposed route is the wrong route and should be rejected.

For this reason, I noted with interest your decision today to reexamine
the proposed route in Nebraska. If the announcement is a sincere effort
to identify a better route within my state, 1 applaud the decision. I
am concerned, however, that the Department's move today may serve
only to delay the final decision until after the Presidential election.

I would be very disappointed if— after investing substantial
additional time — the Department's ultimate decision on TransCanada's
permit application approves the current proposed Nebraska route.

Considering your agency has studied the proposed route for several
years, keeping it under consideration makes no sense given today's
announcement. Please therefore consider this letter a formal request
that the Department of State immediately acknowledge that the current
route is no longer being considered.

Thank you for your consideration of this request. I look forward to
your reply.
