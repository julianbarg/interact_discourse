Politics and opportunism

Nov 24, 2011

Like most Nebraskans, I'm heaving a sigh of relief that the Keystone XL
pipeline will be rerouted. I'm especially grateful to state Sens. Ken
Haar and Annette Dubas, who led the way in representing the people
of our state.

The biggest round of applause, of course, goes to the leadership from
the grass-roots campaign. They're the ones who did the heavy lifting.

But surely I'm not the only one disappointed with Gov. Dave Heineman
and his minions in the Legislature who only embrace a movement once
they've calculated the political value or risks involved. Joining
a successful movement after it has gained significant momentum and
then climbing in front of it isn't leadership; it's opportunism and
politics at its shabbiest.

We have so many recent examples of how the citizens' and taxpayers'
needs and prerogatives are weighed before action is taken: the mess at
the Beatrice State Developmental Center, the push for road construction
over aid to schools, raiding the Environmental Trust and exposure to
lawsuits when we privatize and fail to oversee our contractors all
spring to mind.

Our state is seriously hurting for leadership in the governor's
office. Thank goodness Heineman is term-limited and can't run again.
