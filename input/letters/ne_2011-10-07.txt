Pony up, governor

Oct 6, 2011 0

It's time for Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman to call a special legislative
session on establishing placement of pipeline routes in Nebraska.

It doesn't set well when the governor says he's against placing the
Keystone XL pipeline over the Sandhills yet bemoans the fact that,
in his opinion, he can't do anything about it.

Hogwash. The time to act is now. Waiting for a road-to-Atkinson
conversion doesn't seem to be in the cards.

His meeting with several TransCanada and Canadian officials recently
and no planned meetings with opposition environmentalists or scientists
is no way to straddle a political fence. Placing responsibility on
others to do his job is unseemly. State Department and congressional
reports state very plainly that oversight of pipeline routing belongs
to each state.

The $10,000 a day it would cost for a special legislative session is
chump change compared to the environmental and economic costs that
Nebraskans face with a spill of heated, toxic, tar-sands oil. This
is the most hotly contested issue Nebraska has seen in decades.

The next move is the governor's. It's time to pony up. If he doesn't
act now, he will be viewed as the all-hat-and-no-horse cowboy governor
who refused to give Nebraska state senators and their constituents
a public hearing on a potential disaster in the making.
