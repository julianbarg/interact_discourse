I am writing to provide you information regarding Nebraska and the
development of the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, since your department
is the lead agency preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act. I understand
and respect that this is a federal regulatory decision. However,
any pipeline development in Nebraska must be done in a prudent and
environmentally safe manner.

Almost 300 miles of the proposed pipeline will come through Nebraska
and be situated directly over the Ogallala Aquifer. This aquifer
provides water to farmers and ranchers of Nebraska to raise livestock
and grow crops. Nebraska has 92,233 registered, active irrigation
wells supplying water to over 8.5 million acres of harvested cropland
and pasture. Of the total cropland harvested during 2007, 46 percent
was irrigated. Maintaining and protecting Nebraska's water supply
is very important to me and the residents of Nebraska. This resource
is the lifeblood of Nebraska's agriculture industry. In 2008,
cash receipts from farm marketings contributed over $17 billion
to Nebraska’s economy and five percent of the United States
total. Nebraskans are concerned that the proposed pipeline route
could contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer and I share that concern.

I encourage you to thoroughly review and evaluate the materials,
input, and comments that you have received to ensure that if the
pipeline is approved, that an appropriate and safe route will be
chosen, and it will be properly constructed, carefully operated, and
well maintained so that Nebraska’s natural resources are protected.

Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.
