Urge special session

Oct 8, 2011

I attended the Keystone XL pipeline hearing a week ago. I was
disappointed that an occasion to allow Nebraskans to be heard by
the State Department was instead flooded with Keystone supporters,
including TransCanada employees and pipeline union workers, few of
whom were actually Nebraskans. It was first come, first serve as to
who got to speak; a Nebraskan would have had to stand in line from
very early in the morning to beat the numerous Keystone people.

I spoke with some union workers, letting them know a majority
of Nebraskans were not against the pipeline, and therefore not
against jobs -- the only message they were there to send -- but
that we strongly disapproved of the route. One union worker asked
if TransCanada had offered us an alternate route. When I said no, he
was surprised and asked me why not. That, of course, is the big issue.

I am disappointed in the lack of leadership from Gov. Dave Heineman and
our Legislature to protect Nebraska's most valuable resources. Heineman
needs to call a special session of the Legislature soon, before it
is too late, to put laws on our books allowing us to regulate the
pipeline route.

He can no longer put the onus on President Barack Obama, or blame
past lack of action from our Legislature. I realize there is a cost
involved, but a smaller cost today will save us much heartache in
years to come when we can no longer rely on our water supply.

I urge people to contact Heineman and their state senator to ask
them to do something now, before we are at the mercy of the federal
government and an oil company that do not have the best interests of
Nebraskans at heart.
