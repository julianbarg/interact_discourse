Observations from hearing

As a working-class Nebraskan who could not attend the Lincoln Keystone
XL public hearing until 5 p.m., I found it interesting to witness
the final three hours of testimony.

Not only did it appear that many of the pro-pipeline individuals
present did not come from Nebraska (as evidenced by the number
congregated throughout the day and staying at the high-end Cornhusker
hotel), it also appeared that those present may have been on the
clock. When hour's end came around, they left Pershing Center in
small groups like their shift had ended.

The individuals who testified against the pipeline, or against its
proposed route, appeared to be genuine residents of Nebraska with
a real concern for the welfare of our state. I found the lack of
political representatives testifying either for or against the
pipeline disheartening.

Representatives from the State Department flew in from Washington
and spent long hours in Lincoln listening to testimony, and our
Nebraska representatives (for the most part) stayed away -- fence
sitting on this issue -- worried about jeopardizing their next bids
for office. Gov. Dave Heineman certainly should call for a special
session and push our representatives into making a decision.
