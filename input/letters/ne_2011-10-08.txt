Call special session

Oct 7, 2011 0

I attended the Keystone XL pipeline hearing at Pershing Center and took
a small part in standing up for our state. It was gratifying for us to
see so many people standing strong to protect the rights of our state.

We want to prosper, but not on the backs of those who are trying to
protect vulnerable areas. I support jobs and revenue in an area east
of the proposed route, out of harm's way for Sandhills country.

I am pleased to see Gov. Dave Heineman supporting and attending our
university sports events and showing his true colors for these and
other institutions. I now respectfully ask him to show his true colors
for Nebraska and call a special session to protect our rights against
a huge corporation.
