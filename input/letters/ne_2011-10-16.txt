Literal vision of hell

Oct 15, 2011

TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline will carry diluted bitumen, an
acidic crude oil that resembles tar, 1,700 miles from the Canadian
province of Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast.

It's quite interesting that the narrative that's been created and
discussed is essentially only about the route of the pipeline, i.e.,
should it be through the Ogallala Aquifer in the Nebraska Sandhills
or rerouted?

I imagine TransCanada is thrilled with this narrative, because it
excludes a more serious discussion: Should this pipeline even be
constructed?

The tar sands of Alberta contain the second-biggest pool of oil on
Earth after the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. The development of this
energy source is an extraordinary construction and investment project,
with enormous profit potential for TransCanada.

It also has turned a Canadian paradise into a literal vision of hell.

Extracting oil from tar sands is much more complicated than pumping
conventional crude. Initially, sands are strip mined, then steam-heated
to produce petroleum slurry. Further thinning is required (by injection
with some combination of steam, air or additives) before the tar
sands can be pumped through a pipeline. These processes require
larger amounts of energy than typical oil extraction and utilize
massive amounts of water and natural gas.

Vast areas of Canadian wilderness have been ravaged and replaced by a
nightmarish landscape of toxic lakes, pit mines and pipelines. The size
of these toxic waste pools is so huge they can be viewed from outer
space. This unrestrained fossil fuel use accompanied by greenhouse
gas emissions are driving us toward environmental disaster.

But in Nebraska, our discussion is not about the recklessness and
attendant potential for worldwide calamity, but simply about the route
of the pipeline. TransCanada has to be ecstatic with this dialogue
in Huskerland.
