Frustration with Heineman

Oct 4, 2011 0

My grandparents and great-grandparents homesteaded in the
Sandhills. Ericson is my hometown. I now live in Lincoln, but my
heart is in the Sandhills.

In the '30s, what a blessing it was just to sink a pipe into the sand
and have a "flowing well" -- wonderful water for our gardens.

If the Keystone XL Pipeline is not rerouted, perhaps a no vote for
Gov. Dave Heineman should be a "done deal." He has abandoned Nebraska
and our legacy for future generations.
