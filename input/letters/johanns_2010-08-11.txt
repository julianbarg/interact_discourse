I write concerning the Keystone XL pipeline project under consideration
by the Department of State. As you may know, I have repeatedly
expressed concern that maximum care be taken to safeguard the Ogallala
Aquifer, an irreplaceable natural resource in the State of Nebraska.
In addition, I have posed questions to both TransCanada and federal
agencies involved in the permitting process and look forward to
receiving answers.

Today, however, I write with a separate but equally serious concern
relating to ongoing negotiations between Nebraska landowners and
TransCanada and the threatened use of eminent domain. I have had
multiple conversations with Nebraskans who have indicated that
TransCanada representatives have established hard deadlines for
landowner responses to offers for easement payments, within as little
two weeks, I am told.

Such deadlines may be the normal course of business for negotiations
between private parties. However, Nebraska landowners are being
told in addition that the use of eminent domain authority will be
triggered if they do not accept the offers extended by TransCanada
within the arbitrary deadlines. The establishment of such deadlines
is especially troubling because TransCanada does not possess the
Presidential Permit required for the project.

I therefore ask for your assurance that:

1. TransCanada will under no circumstances terminate negotiations or
otherwise refuse to further negotiate with any landowner, or threaten
landowners with the use of eminent domain while TransCanadaâ€™s permit
application remains pending;

2. TransCanada will immediately notify landowners that negotiation
deadlines have been withdrawn.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I would appreciate
a reply on or before September 14, 2010. If TransCanada has established
a deadline with any Nebraska landowner that expires prior to September
14, 2010, I ask that you respond prior to that deadline, and confirm
that you have notified landowners that any such deadline has been
withdrawn.
