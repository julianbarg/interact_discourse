Dear Secretary Clinton:

I write today to request that the Department of State conduct
a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to the Keystone
Xl. pipeline Draft Environmental Impact Statement. As you know,
several court cases have established that "the existence of
reasonable but unexamined alternatives renders an EIS inadequate."
Additionally, NEPA law, as well as Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) regulations requires EISs to rigorously explore and
objectively evaluate a full spectrum of reasonable and feasible
alternatives.

I believe that the Department of State has not yet sufficiently
analyzed alternative pipeline routes and associated environmental
concerns. Thus, I respectfully request that a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement examine at a minimum: (1) additional
pipeline entry points into the United States and consider a route that
would run parallel to the existing Keystone pipeline route; (2) any
potential environmental benefit to a route that avoids the Sandhills
region; and (3) any environmental significance of soil composition.

I, along with many Nebraskans, remain concerned that the health of the
Ogallala Aquifer may be unnecessarily put at risk by the current route
proposed for the Keystone XI. pipeline. Conducting a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement will increase the transparency of the
environmental review process by providing a formal avenue to assess
and respond to remaining concerns.

I appreciate your consideration of my request for a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement and I look forward to your reply.
