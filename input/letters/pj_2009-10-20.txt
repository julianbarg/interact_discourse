Dakota Rural Action ("DRA") wishes to inform the Commission that DRA
and its members intend to participate in the upcoming Keystone XL
hearing through the Tuesday night public comment opportunity rather
than by presenting witnesses during the evidentiary hearing. DRA's
members have determined that their comments to the Commission are
appropriate for the public comment process such that they have decided
to not participate as witnesses. Unlike the Commission, DRA does not
have the resources needed to hire the expert witnesses required to
respond to TransCanada's experts, therefore DRA will not be providing
expert testimony. Instead, DRA encourages Commission staff in their
efforts to protect the public and urges the Commission to fully
consider the concerns and requests provided by citizens during the
public comment period.

DRA also intends to provide the Commission with documents related to
specific concerns, some of which DRA acquired from TransCanada in the
discovery process, some of which it found on its own. Unfortunately,
TransCanada's responses to DRA's information requests have proven
to be of little worth. Worse, TransCanada's actions have severely
hindered DRA's efforts in this proceeding and consumed time and
resources that DRA had intended to commit to preparation for the
upcoming hearing. Specifically, TransCanada:

• unreasonably opposed some of DRA's information requests, thereby
delaying the Commission's proceeding and consuming DRA's limited
resources with unnecessary argument;

• buried the small amount of relevant information it provided in
thousands upon thousands of pages of irrelevant, illegible, unusable,
or marginally relevant material; and

• appears to have withheld substantial amounts of relevant material
even after direct order by the Commission (detailed below).

The following identifies documents requested by DRA that TransCanada
appears to have failed to disclose. **FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
RELATED TO SETBACKS AND PROTECTION OF**

**LANDOWNERS FROM MAJOR PIPELINE RUPTURES**

DRA sought information related to setbacks, the risks mitigated by
setbacks including the risk of injury and damage caused by major
pipeline ruptures, and other measures to mitigate these risks. In its
response, TransCanada sent a very large volume of material, much of
which is irrelevant or of very limited relevance and none of which
is directly related to setbacks. Of the thousands and thousands of
sheets of paper provided, it appears that only a few pages, related to
the spray and pool zones from the 1979 Bemidji, MN Enbridge pipeline
spill, are directly related to the immediate damage caused by a major
pipeline rupture.

In response to DRA's assertions that TransCanada had not provided any
documents related to setbacks, James Moore, Attorney for TransCanada
stated in Commission's September 23 hearing that "we don't have
additional documents in the Keystone files that are responsive to this
request. We've produced everything we have." Transcript p. 14. James
White, also an attorney for TransCanada, supplemented Mr. Moore's
statements by noting that, "There is one document that's arguably
responsible that was not produced, and that was a document that's
subject to the objection to the extent that materials involve high
consequence areas. There's a document called Evaluation of Risk to High
Consequence Areas, which defined portions of the project, which if a
spill occurred, would have the potential to reach a high consequence
area. . . . So that single document was not produced." TransCanada has
produced a redacted version of this document, which contains little
information directly related to the risks mitigated by setbacks or
measures intended to mitigate these types of risks.

However, during a search for information related to setbacks and the
immediate damage caused by release of oil from very high pressure
pipelines necessitated by the lack of useful information provided
by TransCanada, it came to DRA's attention that TransCanada, or its
corporate affiliates, participated in the Pipelines and Informed
Planning Alliance ("PIPA") process. This US federal stakeholder
process began in August 2007 and related to investigation of land
use planning measures, such as setbacks, that mitigate the risks
posed by pipelines. The process involved most if not all of the major
pipeline companies and at least 24 organizations, such as the National
Association of Counties, the National Association of Home Builders,
the National Association of State Fire Marshalls, various industry
trade groups, and a number of federal agencies.

PIPA documentation states that TransCanada assigned Alex Osborne to
represent it on Task Team 1 and Steve McNulty to represent it on
Task Team 3. Belinda Friis and Brad Watson are also identified as
representing TransCanada in this process. DRA understands that Belinda
Friis has served for 14 years as Senior Counsel with TransCanada
primarily supporting ANR Pipeline Company, and that Brad Watson is
a Senior Technologist for TransCanada.

In April 2009, after exchange of written comments, the PIPA process
produced a 104 page Draft Report entitled "Partnering to Further
Enhance Pipeline Safety in Communities through Informed Land Use
Planning." The Draft Report contains 49 possible recommended practices
related to local land use controls, including among other things,
a discussion of setbacks, "consultation zones," and modification of
local land use plans to address pipeline safety concerns.

TransCanada's voluminous response to Request 1 does not contain the
PIPA Draft Report and it also does not appear to contain any reference
to the PIPA process.

It is beyond belief that TransCanada was and is unaware of the PIPA
process, that it has no documents about this process, and that none
of its four employees who participated in this process retained
any files whatsoever. Further, TransCanada's failure to provide
documents related to the PIPA process casts substantial doubt on its
claims that it has no documents related to setbacks or other similar
mitigation measures. Rather, it appears that the PIPA process was
of substantial concern to TransCanada and that TransCanada chose to
withhold information about this process. Therefore, it appears that,
at a minimum, TransCanada did not diligently search its files, and at
worst may have made false or misleading statements to the Commission.

**FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATED TO MAINTAINING SOIL DEPTH
OF COVER**

DRA sought information related to monitoring and maintaining depth
of cover, which is a key method used to reduce the risk of damage to
pipelines that could result in leaks and major ruptures. In

response, TransCanada initially sent thousands of pages of material
much of which was irrelevant or illegible, the remainder of which
was marginally relevant, and none of which related to monitoring
and maintaining depth of cover over pipelines. Due to TransCanada's
failure to provide relevant material, on September 23, the Commission
ordered TransCanada to disclose all documents related to methods
and procedures for monitoring and maintaining depth of cover. In
response, TransCanada provided Exhibit V containing four documents,
including a Portable Electronic Pipe and Cable Locator Specification
and three relatively short and summary TransCanada Operating Procedures
entitled "Line Locator Inspection," "Pipeline Ground Based Patrols,"
and "Aerial Pipeline Patrol."

Due to the limited worth of the material provided, DRA conducted
research to identify other documents that might help landowners
understand the monitoring and maintenance of depth of cover. DRA
learned that on May 11, 2008, TransCanada submitted comments to the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") on
the federal natural gas maximum allowable operating pressure draft
regulations, including comments on depth of cover. On page 16 of its
comments, TransCanada asserted that depth of cover cannot be maintained
and made factual statements related to a general lack of need to
maintain depth of cover. Although TransCanada did not cite its source
for these assertions, it appears that TransCanada relied on a May 19,
2008, White Paper prepared by the Interstate Natural Gas Association
of America ("INGAA"), which contains similar language on pages 25 and
26, and states that the industry had conducted studies on depth of
cover. Importantly, these studies apparently include an assessment
of the potential for loss of depth of cover in agricultural areas.

Since DRA did not limit its depth of cover request to only oil
pipelines, and since loss of depth of cover over a pipeline is not
dependent on the nature of a product transported by a pipeline,
documents in TransCanada's possession related to this federal
rulemaking are relevant to this proceeding. It is difficult to
believe that TransCanada is unaware of its public formal written
position on depth of cover and does not have access to the studies
referenced by the INGAA documents. It is also difficult to believe
that TransCanada's entire library on monitoring and maintaining depth
of cover over pipelines comprises only four documents.

**FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT PIPELINE ABANDONMENT**

DRA sought information related to abandonment of pipelines, because
its landowner members are concerned that they not bear the costs of
removal or stabilization of this 3 foot diameter steel pipeline or
be subjected to the safety risks this pipeline will create once it
is abandoned. In response to this request, TransCanada initially
provided only one document, specifically an internal operating
procedure related to abandonment. In its motion to compel, DRA
noted that TransCanada had participated in the Canadian National
Energy Board Land Matters Consultative Initiative ("LMCI") process,
including two information gathering and policy development processes
related to pipeline abandonment, and yet had not produced a single
document from this process. On September 23, the Commission ordered
TransCanada to produce documents related to the LMCI process.

TransCanada responded to this order by producing Exhibit S, which
contains a number of documents related to the LMCI process. Due
to TransCanada's failure to separate these documents from each
other, it is difficult to determine which of these documents
are included as attachments to other documents. Nonetheless, it
appears that TransCanada has provided only documents authored by
it, its affiliates, its attorneys, or the Canadian government,
and has omitted documents authored by other participants in this
process, except for limited documents that appear to be attachments
to TransCanada filings. Since the documents provided by TransCanada
contain its responses to documents filed by other participants, and
after further web research related to the filings of other entities,
it is clear that TransCanada had or has many more LMCI documents than
it provided, and that TransCanada may have cherry picked only those
documents it authored and a few Canadian government documents. Unless

TransCanada has purged all of its files of LCMI documents authored by
other entities, it has failed to comply with the Commission's order
on this matter.

**FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATED TO DEMAND FORECASTS**

DRA sought information related to western Canadian crude oil production
forecasts and US crude oil demand forecasts to confirm demand for
the Proposed Pipeline and to determine whether lowered demand would
result in a delay in the start date for construction of the Proposed
Pipeline. TransCanada refused to provide documents related to this
request. On September 23, 2009, the Commission ordered TransCanada
to respond to these requests. In response, TransCanada provided two
publically available documents, the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers 2009 forecast, and the US Energy Information Administration's
2009 Annual Energy Outlook, both of which DRA has previously referenced
in this proceeding.

It is difficult to believe that a company of the size and capacity
of TransCanada relies for its demand forecasts for a multi-billion
dollar project entirely on two publically available reports. Further,
if we assume for the sake of argument that these publically available
documents contain the only data on which TransCanada relies for
its planning, TransCanada should have disclosed this fact and
produced these documents in its first response rather than withhold
them. Instead, TransCanada's actions required that DRA spend weeks
of effort to acquire two documents that it knew from other filings
that DRA already possessed.

In sum, it appears that TransCanada has systematically withheld
relevant documents and unreasonably withheld documents it ultimately
was required to disclose. Further, a large proportion of the documents
that TransCanada provided were irrelevant, illegible, and poorly
organized, with the result that DRA's review of these documents was
substantially more time consuming than necessary. As such, DRA believes
that TransCanada has acted in bad faith during this discovery process,
with the result that the discovery process required effort that far
outweighs the value of the material provided by TransCanada. Given the
relative sizes and capacities of TransCanada and DRA, such behavior by
TransCanada is unacceptable. Due to resource and schedule constraints
and in belief that additional efforts to compel TransCanada to produce
documents would further waste the Commission's and DRA's time, DRA does
not intend to file a subsequent motion to compel. This being said, DRA
reserves any legal rights it may have with regard to the Commission's
discovery process, including those related to the Commission's scope
of jurisdiction. For now, DRA intends to focus its limited resources on
assisting landowners in other efforts to protect their families, homes,
lands, and businesses from this massive and dangerous project. Very
truly yours, Paul C. Blackburn Attorney for Dakota Rural Action
