Special session needed

Sep 5, 2011 0

Thanks to Gov. Dave Heineman for taking a stand against the Keystone
XL pipeline ("Pointing fingers," Sept. 1). Now it's time for him to
put action behind his words.

I call for Gov. Heineman to call a special session of the Legislature
to reroute the pipeline away from the Sandhills and the Ogallala
Aquifer.

If he doesn't deal with this important issue, we'll know his opposition
is purely political and an effort to straddle the fence. Don't play
politics with our water.
