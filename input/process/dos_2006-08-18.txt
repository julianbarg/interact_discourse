## Receipt of Application for a Permit for Pipeline Facilities To Be Constructed and Maintained on the Borders of the United States

A Notice by the State Department on 08/18/2006

Department of State.

The Department of State has received an application from TransCanada
Keystone Pipeline, LP (“Keystone”) for a Presidential permit,
pursuant to Executive Order 11423 of August 16, 1968, as amended by
Executive Order 12847 of May 17, 1993, and Executive Order 13284 of
January 23, 2003 to construct, connect, operate, and maintain the
Keystone Pipeline Project at the U.S.-Canadian border at Cavalier
County, North Dakota, for the purpose of transporting Canadian crude
oil production from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”)
to existing terminals in Missouri, Illinois, and potentially, Oklahoma.

TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP, is a limited liability company,
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Keystone is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada Oil Pipelines Inc., a Delaware
Corporation, with its principal office located at 450 1st Street,
SW., Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 5H1. The proposed new pipeline
would consist in the U.S. of 1,018 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline
and 55 miles of 24-inch diameter pipeline (“Keystone Mainline”)
from the U.S.-Canadian border at Cavalier County, North Dakota, to
Patoka, Illinois. If the extension to Cushing, Oklahoma (“Cushing
Extension”) is constructed, it will consist of an additional 291
miles of 30-inch pipeline for a total of 1365 miles of pipeline. In
Canada, the project would involve the sale to Keystone of an existing
530 mile, 34-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline currently
owned by TransCanada Limited and conversion of that line to crude oil
service. In addition, Keystone will construct 230 miles of pipeline
from Hardisty to the converted line and an additional 62 miles of
pipeline from the converted line to the U.S. border.

As required by E.O. 13337, the Department of State is circulating
this application to concerned Federal agencies for comment.
