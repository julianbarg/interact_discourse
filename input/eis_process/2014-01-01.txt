**PROCESS**

The Keystone XL Pipeline (the proposed Project) is a proposed
875-mile pipeline project that would extend from Morgan, Montana,
to Steele City, Nebraska. The pipeline would allow delivery of up to
830,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from the Western Canadian
Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) in Canada and the Bakken Shale Formation
in the United States to Steele City, Nebraska, for onward delivery
to refineries in the Gulf Coast area (see Figure ES-1). TransCanada
Keystone Pipeline, LP (Keystone) has applied for a Presidential Permit
that, if granted, would authorize the proposed pipeline to cross the
United States-Canadian border at Morgan, Montana.

The proposed route differs from the route analyzed in the 2011 Final
Environmental Impact Statement (2011 Final EIS) in that it would avoid
the environmentally sensitive Nebraska Department of Environmental
Quality (NDEQ)-identified Sand Hills Region and no longer includes
a southern segment from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast area.

The U.S. Department of State (the Department) prepared this Final
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (the Supplemental EIS)
to assess the potential impacts associated with the proposed Project
and its alternatives. The Supplemental EIS takes into consideration
over 400,000 comments received during the scoping period and 1.5
million comments received on the Draft Supplemental EIS issued in
March 2013. Notable changes since the Draft Supplemental EIS include:

• Expanded analysis of potential oil releases;

• Expanded climate change analysis;

• Updated oil market analysis incorporating new economic modeling;
and

• Expanded analysis of rail transport as part of the No Action
Alternative scenarios.
