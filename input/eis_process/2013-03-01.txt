ES.1 **INTRODUCTION**

**ES.1.1 Overview**

The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline is a new 875-mile pipeline
infrastructure project that would allow delivery of up to 830,000
barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, and the
Bakken Shale Formation in the United States to Steele City, Nebraska
for onward delivery to Cushing, Oklahoma, and refineries in the Gulf
Coast area1

1 The Gulf Coast area refers to the region from Houston, Texas,
to Lake Charles, Louisiana.

. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP (Keystone) has applied for a
Presidential Permit which, if granted, would authorize the proposed
pipeline to cross the United States-Canadian border.

For proposed petroleum pipelines that cross international borders
of the United States, the President, through Executive Order 13337,
directs the Secretary of State to decide whether a project is in the
"national interest" before granting a Presidential Permit. The national
interest determination by the U.S. Department of State (the Department)
involves consideration of many factors, including energy security;
environmental, cultural, and economic impacts; foreign policy; and
compliance with relevant federal regulations. Before making such a
decision, the Department also asks for the views of the Departments of
Energy, Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security, Justice, Interior,
and Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

**ES.3.2 Supplemental EIS Process**

In September 2012, Keystone submitted an Environmental Report in
support of its Presidential Permit application providing an update
of the impacts of the proposed Project and describing several
modifications to the originally proposed pipeline route to reduce
environmental impacts, improve constructability, and in response to
agency and public comments.

To assist in preparing the draft Supplemental EIS, the Department
retained an environmental consulting firm, Environmental Resources
Management, Inc. (ERM). ERM was selected pursuant to the Department's
interim guidance on the selection of independent third-party
contractors. ERM works at the sole and exclusive instruction of the
Department and is not permitted to communicate with Keystone unless
specifically directed to do so by Department officials. Preparation
of the draft Supplemental EIS

occurred over a 5-month period and included consultation with ERM,
cooperating agencies, scientists, and engineers with expertise in
key areas of concern related to the proposed Project.

This draft Supplemental EIS describes potential impacts of the
proposed Project and alternatives, including direct, indirect, and
cumulative impacts. It builds on the work done in the 2011 Final
EIS, including references to that document throughout the text
where appropriate. The Supplemental EIS includes an analysis of the
modified route in Nebraska, as well as analysis of any significant
new circumstances or information that has become available since the
August 2011 publication of the Final EIS for the previously proposed
project. This draft Supplemental EIS also relies, where appropriate,
on the data presented and the analyses done in the Final EIS for the
previously proposed project, because much of the proposed pipeline
route remains unchanged from its August 2011 publication. Finally, the
draft Supplemental EIS also includes the latest available information
on the proposed Project resulting from ongoing discussions with
federal, state, and local agencies.
