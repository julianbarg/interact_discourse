**Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming**

In attempting to meet the purpose and need for the Keystone Project, construction and operation of the proposed Project would incrementally increase the cumulative impact of greenhouse gas emissions. 
The carbon emissions associated with construction and operation would occur irrespective of the routing of the pipeline. 
However, the ultimate construction and operation of the pipeline would offset potential emissions associated with other methodologies for meeting the demand for imported crude oil, such as delivery of crude oil by tanker from alternative international sources. 
Keystone has committed to restoration and replanting of vegetative cover along the proposed pipeline corridor to the extent compatible with safety and operational requirements. 
This commitment would allow any advantages associated with carbon sinks along the proposed corridor to be reestablished after temporary disruption during the construction phase. 
Therefore, the incremental contribution to greenhouse gas emissions associated with construction and operation of the proposed Keystone is likely to be relatively small compared to the nationwide production of greenhouse gases on an annual basis.
