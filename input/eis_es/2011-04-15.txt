**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP (Keystone) applied to the
U.S. Department of State (DOS) for a

Presidential Permit for the proposed construction, connection,
operation, and maintenance of a pipeline and associated facilities at
the United States border for importation of crude oil from Canada. The

Keystone application is for its proposed Keystone XL Project (the
proposed Project). Keystone also filed a right-of-way application
under Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA), as amended
with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the proposed Project
across federal lands. DOS served as the lead federal agency for the
environmental review of the proposed Project under the National

Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and issued a draft environmental
impact statement (EIS) for public review on April 16, 2010. The public
comment period for the draft EIS closed on July 2, 2010.

After the draft EIS was issued, new information and additional
information became available on the proposed Project and on issues and
resources related to the potential impacts of the proposed Project. To
provide the public with the opportunity to review this information and
to ensure openness and transparency in the NEPA environmental review
process of the proposed Project, DOS has issued this supplemental
draft EIS (SDEIS). While Secretarial Order 3310 *Protecting Wilderness
Characteristic on*

*Lands Managed by the BLM* was issued after publication of the draft
EIS by Interior Secretary Salazar on

December 22, 2010, the analysis of the implications of the Order on
the proposed Project is ongoing.

BLM will comply with the Order implementation in its processing of
the Keystone application under the

**Adequacy of the Draft EIS**

The draft EIS was developed in compliance with the scoping process
required under NEPA and in compliance with the Council on Environmental
Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations. It includes relevant issues raised by
the public and the agencies during the scoping period. DOS received
thousands of comments on a wide variety of topics addressed in the
draft EIS during the draft EIS comment period.

Some commenters expressed concern that the draft EIS did not provide
a sufficient analysis of the impacts of the proposed Project and
requested that DOS issue an SDEIS for public review.

As part of its continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the draft EIS,
DOS analyzed the new and additional information that became available
after the draft EIS was issued and made a preliminary determination
that there are no significant new circumstances or information
concerning the proposed

Project or its potential impacts not already considered in the draft
EIS. The analysis further noted that while the range of alternatives
to the proposed action considered in the draft EIS was sufficient
to meet the requirements of NEPA, additional alternatives should
be considered in response to public comments on the draft EIS. DOS
therefore determined that submitting the portions of the EIS that were
revised to address the new and additional information and to address
related comments on the draft EIS for public and agency review would
further the purposes of NEPA. As a result, DOS prepared and issued this

**Contents of the SDEIS**

The SDEIS has been prepared and circulated in compliance with CEQ
NEPA regulations and DOS

guidelines (*Using Existing Environmental Analyses*). It includes
copies of new reports and other documents relevant to the proposed
Project and revisions to portions of the draft EIS.

To focus public attention on the topics that DOS determined would be
of value for additional review, the

SDEIS provides only information directly or indirectly related to
those topics and does not include all sections that were presented
in the draft EIS. However, the SDEIS incorporates the draft EIS by
reference in compliance with CEQ NEPA regulations. The draft EIS is
available for download from the

DOS Keystone XL Project related website
(www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov). The SDEIS addresses the following
key issues:

**Revised information on proposed Project facilities; design,
construction and maintenance, regulatory requirements; and potential
connected actions**

• Information on changes to the proposed Project facilities and
construction of those facilities associated with withdrawal of the
special permit application by Keystone and incorporation of the

57 Project-specific Special Conditions recommended by the
U.S. Department of Transportation,

Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) that
would apply for the lifetime of the proposed Project (e.g., lower
maximum throughput and lower operating pressure than in the draft
EIS, revised pipe wall thicknesses, change to the distance between
mainline valves, and changes to construction procedures addressed by
the Special Conditions);

• Relocation of the tank farm from Steele City, Nebraska to Cushing,
Oklahoma;

• Revisions to Operations and Maintenance information due to
incorporation of the 57 Project-

specific PHMSA Special Conditions and in response to comments on the
draft EIS, including additional information on the development and
review of a Project-specific Emergency Response

• Two additional non-federal connected actions, the Bakken Marketlink
Project and the Cushing

Marketlink Project, that were developed after the draft EIS was issued,
and the potential impacts of implementation of those projects based
on currently available information; and

• Additional information on future plans and decommissioning.

**Additional information on groundwater, potential spill impacts,
alternatives to the proposed Project, and environmental justice
considerations**

• Additional information on potential impacts to groundwater due
to an unintentional release of crude oil from the proposed Project,
including additional information on the Northern High Plains

Aquifer (NHPAQ) system, which includes the Ogallala aquifer, and the
Sand Hills topographic region of Nebraska;

• Assessments of additional potential alternatives developed after
the draft EIS was issued,

including additional system alternatives, additional route alternatives
(including alternative routes developed to avoid or minimize the
distances through the Sand Hills topographic region and areas overlying
the NHPAQ system), pipeline design alternatives, and alternatives to
the locations of aboveground facilities; and

• Expanded information on environmental justice issues in response
to EPA comments on the draft

**Additional information on crude oil composition, potential refinery
emissions, and greenhouse gas (GHG) and climate change considerations**

• Additional information on the composition of the crude oil that
would be transported by the proposed Project and comparisons of that
crude oil to other crude oils currently being refined in

Petroleum Administration Defense District (PADD) II and PADD III and
revisions to the Oil

Spill Risk Assessment and Environmental Consequences section (that
section has also been renamed to "Potential Releases from Project
Construction and Operation and Environmental

Consequence Analysis"); and

• Additional information on GHG emissions associated with the
proposed Project based on information provided in recently completed
reports (described below).

The main body of the SDEIS includes portions of sections of the EIS
that have been revised to address the new and additional information,
and in some cases, the entire section. To provide the proper context
for the expanded, updated, and new information relevant to the NEPA
environmental review of the proposed

Project, the following sections are included in their entirety:

• Section 3.13 (Potential Releases from Project Construction and
Operation and Environmental

Consequences Analysis); and

• Section 4.0 (Alternatives).

Other sections of the SDEIS provide portions of revised EIS sections
relevant to the topics listed above,

including expansions of assessments of key environmental concerns
that were included in the draft EIS

and new information that was developed in response to comments
on the draft EIS. Section 1.0 has been reorganized to include new
sections for the Presidential Permit review process (Section 1.3)
and an overview of the crude oil market (Section 1.4). Sections 1.2
(Purpose and Need), 1.3 and 1.4 of the

SDEIS replace Section 1.2 of the draft EIS.

The portions of the EIS that are not included in the SDEIS have not
been substantively revised. They will be included in the final EIS
with minor revisions, including edits for clarification, corrections
of typographical errors, minor expansion of existing information,
and updates where appropriate. The final

EIS will also include responses to comments on the draft EIS and
responses to comments on the SDEIS.

The SDEIS also includes the following documents as appendices:

• A 2010 report prepared by EnSys Energy and Systems, Inc. (EnSys)
contracted by the U.S.

Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Policy & International
Affairs. DOE contracted EnSys to evaluate different North American
crude oil transport scenarios through 2030 to assist DOS in better
understanding the potential impacts of the presence or absence of
the proposed Project on

U.S. refining and petroleum imports and also on international
markets. The study also assessed global life-cycle GHG impacts of the
scenarios evaluated. Although the study is a contractor report and does
not necessarily represent the views of any U.S. government agency,
it was conducted in close collaboration with and had significant
input from DOE. The EnSys report,

presented in Appendix A, was previously made available for public
review on the DOS website as described in the notice of availability
in the Federal Register on February 14, 2011 (Volume

76, Number 30);

• A 2011 report by ICF International (ICF) that was requested by
DOS to assist in addressing concerns relative to GHG emissions. The
report provides a detailed review of key studies in the existing
literature that address life-cycle GHG emissions of petroleum products,
particularly petroleum products derived from WCSB oil sands. The ICF
report is presented in Appendix B;

• A set of 57 Project-specific Special Conditions developed in
close consultation with PHMSA.

Originally, PHMSA began development of these conditions in
consideration of a special permit request from Keystone that, if
granted, would have allowed Keystone to operate the proposed

Project at a maximum operating pressure higher than that specified
in 49 CFR 195.106. On

August 5, 2010, Keystone withdrew its application to PHMSA for a
special permit. However,

DOS continued to work with PHMSA and Keystone to develop Special
Conditions in response to comments on the draft EIS regarding pipeline
construction, operation, and maintenance.

Keystone agreed to incorporate the Special Conditions into the proposed
Project and if it is authorized and implemented, Keystone will include
those conditions in its manual for operations,

maintenance, and emergencies that is required by 49 CFR 195.402. The
Special Conditions are presented in Appendix C;

• Information provided by Keystone in response to a Data Request
from DOS regarding proposed construction procedures through the Sand
Hills topographic region and consultation with the appropriate experts
on the Sand Hills topographic region. This information is presented in

Appendix D; and

• Water well data along the Proposed Keystone XL Project Route that
was obtained by the DOS

third-party contractor to expand information on existing groundwater
conditions along the proposed route as a part of understanding the
potential impacts of an unintentional release of crude oil from the
proposed Project. This information is presented in Appendix E.

**Status of the DOS Review Process**

**Environmental Review Process**

This SDEIS was prepared by revising portions of the text of the draft
EIS in response to comments on the draft EIS and (as required) to
address the information available after the draft EIS was issued. In
addition, portions of the text of the draft EIS were updated using
information that became available after the draft EIS was issued
and portions of the text were edited to provide greater clarity. DOS
invites interested parties to comment on this SDEIS during the 45-day
comment period, which will begin on

April 22, 2011 when EPA publishes a Notice of Availability (NOA)
in the Federal Register and will end on June 6, 2011. DOS requests
that comments be limited to the subject matter addressed in this SDEIS.

DOS will consider all comments received during the comment period in
preparation of the final EIS.

Commenters do not need to resubmit their earlier comments on the draft
EIS. Comments postmarked after the close of comment period will be
considered to the extent practicable.

Comments on the SDEIS can be submitted to DOS using any of the
following methods:

• DOS Keystone XL Project website:
http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov

• Email: keystonexl@cardno.com

• Mail: Keystone XL EIS Project, P.O. Box 96503-98500, Washington,
D.C. 20090-6503

• Fax: 206-269-0098

**National Interest Determination**

After receipt of comments on the SDEIS and subsequent publication of
a final EIS, DOS will begin a 90-

day period for consultations with other federal agencies to determine
if issuing a Presidential Permit for the proposed Project is in the
National Interest. In addition, for the first 30 days after the final
EIS is published, the public will also have the opportunity to comment
on the National Interest Determination

(NID). DOS plans to conduct another public meeting during this 30-day
comment period. DOS expects a decision on whether to grant or deny
the permit before the end of 2011.

**Conclusions**

The draft EIS provided information on key environmental issues
to allow a full understanding of the analysis of environmental
effects. Although DOS received thousands of comments on a wide variety
of topics addressed in the draft EIS during the comment period,
no new issues of substance emerged from the comments received. DOS
nonetheless determined that submitting the portions of the EIS that
were revised to address the new and additional information and to
address comments on the draft EIS for public and agency review would
further the purposes of NEPA and prepared and issued this SDEIS.

However, the information provided in this SDEIS does not alter the
conclusions reached in the draft EIS

regarding the need for and the potential impacts of the proposed
Project.
