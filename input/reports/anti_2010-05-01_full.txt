The carbon emissions from tar shale and tar sands would initiate
a continual unfolding of climate disasters over the course of this
century. We would be miserable stewards of creation. We would rob
our own children and grandchildren.

-- James Hansen, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space
Studies

Petroleum is a problem. For the sake of oil profits, human rights are
violated, ecosystems de- spoiled, and the planet over-heated. Now,
the industry is seeking out ever more remote and high-carbon sources
of oil. The largest of those dirty and expensive sources, the bitumen
found under the forests of Alberta, Canada, is the subject of this
report.

This oil is known traditionally as tar sands -- or oil sands (the
two terms are synonymous) -- and is undergoing a reckless ex- pansion
that is arguably the largest and most destructive project on earth.

The good news is that technologies now exist that can transform
energy and transportation systems and reduce reliance on oil. It's
already happening. Yet, while North America is on the verge of a
cleaner, more energy independent future, the oil industry in Canada
is planning to triple exports of dirty and expensive tar sands oil
to the United States.

Unlike conventional oil, tar sands oil comes from a hydrocarbon
called bitumen found under the largest remaining ecosys- tem: the
Boreal Forest. The oil industry strip mines and drills pristine
forests and wetlands to get at the bitumen, which lies under the
trees and is mixed with sand and clay. The industry then separates the
bitumen, thins it down and pipes it out for refining into gasoline and
diesel. In the process, giant swaths of forest and bird habitat are
lost forever. An area the size of Florida will become a wasteland if
tar sands growth goes unchecked; most of this land has already been
leased for development.

Oil companies are recklessly expanding this industry, escalating ex-
cavation in Canada, and pushing for additional pipeline and refinery
capacity in the United States. Hundreds of billions of dollars are qui-
etly being invested in these high-carbon highly polluting projects,
despite the fact that they will commit us to decades of continued
dependence on dirty and expensive oil.

While the tar sands oil development represents a major environmen- tal
disaster in Alberta, it also directly threatens U.S. communities. The
infrastructure needed for tar sands in the United States requires a
network of pipelines and refineries crisscrossing the Northern Plains
and Midwest that will affect farmers, ranchers, Native Americans,
and the residents of industrial areas. Oil spills, frequent toxic
emissions, and other environmental threats to the Great Lakes are
all part of the dirty panorama of the tar sands industry.

Tar sands are a global disaster as well, because they will all but
guar- antee the failure of efforts to combat global warming. One of
the world's leading climate scientists, James Hansen has written that
"[t]he tar sands of Canada constitute one of our planet's greatest
threats. They are a double-barreled threat. First, producing oil from
tar sands emits two to three times the global warming pollution of
conventional oil. But the process also diminishes one of the best car-
bon reduction tools on the planet -- Canada's Boreal Forest." 2

Tar sands do not enhance energy security simply because they come
from a friendly neighbor. Continued reliance on oil empowers all
countries that are major oil exporters, including Saudi Arabia and
Iran. The best investments in energy secu- rity are investments in
alternatives to oil. Fortunately, the best investments also clean up
the local environment, combat global warming, and create home-grown
jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Most major forecasts agree that demand for oil in the United States
has peaked and will soon decline. With efficiency mea- sures and
cleaner vehicles such as hybrids and fully electric cars, oil use
can drop dramatically in the next decade and all of us will be better
for it.3 Oil will remain, for some time, a part of the fuel mix, but
America does not need an expansion of tar sands oil, especially when
the environmental and public health cost is so high. The decline of
demand for fossil fuels and the rise of alternative energy has put
America on the verge of a tremendously important step toward a new
energy economy. Expanding reliance on tar sands oil would represent
the proverbial two steps back.

Considering the size and significance of the tar sands project, it is
remarkable that most Americans have never heard of it. This report
is an introduction to the subject of tar sands and a guide for how
to prevent the reckless expansion of a dirty and expensive industry.

Tar sands production consumes and contaminates enormous amounts of
fresh water --- up to four gallons for every one gallon of crude oil
produced. Processing mined tar sands creates toxic waste that is held
in ponds so massive they are visible from space.

executive Summary tAr SAndS invASion: how dirty And exPenSive oil
from cAnAdA threAtenS AmericA'S new enerGy economy

The oil industry is currently planning a massive project to export mil-
lions of barrels more per day of dirty tar sands oil from Alberta to
the United States. Tar sands mining and drilling in Canada's Boreal
Forest is the largest and most destructive project on earth. The
decline of demand for oil and the rise of alternative energy put North
America on the verge of a phenomenally important step forward toward
a new energy economy. Expanding reliance on tar sands is unnecessary,
undermines our progress, and moves us backward instead of forward.

tar Sands are dirty and expensive Canadian tar sands deposits are
found primarily under Alberta's Boreal Forest and wetlands in an area
about the size of Florida.4 In order to access it, millions of acres
of pristine forest and wildlife habitat are strip-mined and drilled,
destroying sensitive habitat and disrupting critical terrestrial carbon
reservoirs in the peatlands of the Boreal Forest. Because it requires
large amounts of energy, production of synthetic crude oil from tar
sands is estimated to release at least three times the greenhouse
gas emissions per barrel as compared to production of conventional
crude oil.5

In addition to its high carbon costs, tar sands oil production
requires two to five barrels of water for each barrel of bitumen ex-
tracted,6 has already created over 50 square miles of toxic waste
ponds,7 threatens the health of downstream indigenous com- munities,8
and is likely to cause the loss of millions of migratory birds that
nest in the forests and wetlands of the region.9

tar Sands oil has real impacts in America The United States is the
main consumer of tar sands oil. 60% of the 1.34 million barrels of tar
sands oil being produced daily in Canada are exported to the United
States, and oil companies are aiming to expand production to as much
as 3.5 million barrels per day (mbd) by 2025.10

In America, oil and pipeline companies plan to build an exten-
sive tar sands pipeline and refinery infrastructure that will lock
the United States into reliance on this high-carbon fossil fuel for
decades. This investment commitment conflicts with tackling global
warming and shifting the U.S. transportation sector to cleaner
alternatives. Further, pipelines bring a danger of oil spills to
America's agricultural heartland, while pollution from refiner- ies
would threaten local communities and the Great Lakes. All of these
environmental consequences are unnecessary because, due to declining
demand and improving energy efficiency, the United States does not
need tar sands oil.

Security lies in reducing dependence on oil The best climate security
policy is to aggressively implement en- ergy efficiency and other
measures that reduce oil dependency. These and other measures stand
to reduce U.S. demand for oil by four million barrels per day by 2020
and ten million barrels per day by 2030, which would make expansion
of tar sands

 unnecessary for U.S. fuel needs.11 Given the climate security risks
 associated with development of the tar sands and other high-carbon
 fuels, we should focus on cleaner, low carbon alternatives.

Further, tar sands oil cannot enhance energy security in the
United States because it is too expensive and there is not enough
of it. Producing tar sands oil will not break the power of OPEC,
which controls the world oil market. Tar sands can- not compete in
a world of low oil prices; in fact, oil from tar sands is among the
most expensive anywhere. Tar sands would not help in the event of
an embargo or natural disaster that disrupts supply, because the tar
sands industry carries no spare capacity.

Solutions for Stopping the tar Sands invasion There are serious costs
and consequences to the United States in encouraging tar sands oil
expansion. Fortunately, there are solutions that policy-makers and
business leaders can put in place now.

Stop expansion of tar sands oil production in Canada. „ Build no more
tar sands pipelines and refineries in the United States. „ Continue
to reduce demand for oil as a transportation fuel. „ Don't spend
taxpayer dollars on buying tar sands oil. „ Eliminate tar sands
oil subsidies and financing. „ Adopt corporate policies that say
no to tar sands oil. „

A better way forward As the world's largest oil consumer, the United
States has choices about its energy future. America currently consumes
a quarter of the world's oil supply. We can and must do better.

Surely a nation this innovative and motivated can find a way to
maintain mobility, while at the same time acting to halt ex- pansion
of expensive and dirty fuels such as tar sands oil that cause global
warming and so many other environmental and health impacts. The
solutions lie in clean, renewable fuel sources, energy efficient
technology and smart growth.

chapter 1 the dirtieSt Project on eArth

Most Americans think of Canada as clean and wild. So it comes as
a shock to learn that what has been called "the most destructive
project on earth" originates in the Canadian province of Alberta.12
But why is this project so destructive?

� � It's huge. The tar sands project is the most costly project
on earth. If expansion in the tar sands goes unchecked, it will mean
mining and drilling an area the size of Florida.

� � The project is wasteful and inefficient. It consumes and
contaminates enormous amounts of fresh water -- up to four gallons of
water for every gallon of crude oil produced. The extraction process
requires moving four tons of earth to produce one barrel of oil.13

� � Tar sands extraction destroys vast swaths of forests and
wetlands and the habitat of wildlife such as woodland caribou and
millions of migratory birds.

� � Processing mined tar sands creates toxic waste that is held
in ponds so massive they are visible from space. � � Tar sands
operations harm the health of communities that depend on local waters
and wildlife, and violate the legal rights of Canadian indigenous
peoples. � � Producing a barrel of synthetic crude oil from tar
sands emits at least three times the global warming pollution as pro-

ducing a barrel of conventional oil, causing the tar sands to be the
fastest growing source of global warming pollution in Canada.

� � If we replace just three million barrels per day of
conventional oil with tar sands oil, the increase in greenhouse gas
emissions would be equivalent to adding more than 20 million new
passenger cars to the road.14

� � Expanding the tar sands industry will require building
an invasive network of pipelines and refineries that will pollute
communities across the United States.

tAr SAndS 101

Tar sands are a combination of clay, sand, water, and bitumen --
a heavy thick black hydrocarbon with the consistency of tar. The
largest deposits of tar sands in the world are in Canada.

Spanning about 55,000 square miles -- an area roughly the size of
Florida -- these deposits are located in the Athabasca, Cold Lake
and Peace River regions of northern Alberta within traditional First
Nations' territories.

For decades, the oil industry virtually ignored tar sands oil because
it was so much more expensive, dirty, and difficult to produce
than conventional oil. But continuing addiction to fossil fuels has
encouraged the oil industry to pursue even the most desperate and
inefficient sources of oil.

 open Pit mining Tar sands oil extraction is a dirty, wasteful,
 and energy- intensive process. The bitumen in Canadian tar sands
 can- not be pumped from the ground like conventional oil, but must
 be mined and melted to be retrieved. Less than 20 percent of the
 tar sands reserves can be mined this way. At these mines, massive
 machines literally dig up the earth and load it into trucks the size
 of houses. Roughly four tons of earth are excavated to produce one
 barrel of oil at these mines, and even then, only about 75 percent of
 the bitu- men is recovered. Each massive truck carries up to 320 tons
 of soil per load to an extraction plant, where a hot water process
 separates the bitumen from the sand, water, and minerals.15 Then,
 because bitumen is so thick, it requires either dilution or upgrading
 before it can be transported by pipeline.

in Situ extraction For tar sands deposits that are too deep for open
pit min- ing -- approximately 80 percent of the tar sands reserves
in Alberta -- the industry uses "in situ" (Latin for "in place") ex-
traction technology. This process involves injecting steam into the
ground to melt the bitumen from the sands and pumping the bitumen up
to the surface.16 While in situ operations don't look as destructive
as the open pit mines, they actually require even more massive amounts
of en- ergy and fragment huge swaths of wildlife and bird habitat.

Bitumen is much heavier than conventional crude oil and contains
various contaminants, and therefore cannot be refined into
transportation fuels with traditional refining machinery. First,
it must undergo a preliminary refining pro-

cess called "upgrading" that transforms the bitumen into "synthetic
crude oil" by removing carbon and impurities. This synthetic crude
oil, which is more similar to conven- tional crude oil, can then be
sent by pipeline to refiner- ies. Increasingly, though, the bitumen
is not upgraded in Canada, but is diluted for pipeline transport to
refineries in the United States that have been retrofitted with upgrad-
ing equipment.

Air and water Pollution Tar sands operations release large volumes of
pollutants into the air. These emissions include nitrogen oxides, sul-
fur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate tAr SAndS 101

matter. These chemicals pollute the air and are known to impact human
and wildlife health.17 For example, sulfur di- oxide and nitrogen
oxides are major contributors to smog and acid rain.

Tar sands mining requires about four gallons of water for every gallon
of crude oil produced. This water comes from the Athabasca River,
which flows nearly 930 miles, past tar sands mines, and on to the
Peace-Athabasca Delta. This delta is the largest boreal delta in the
world, and one of the most important nesting and staging grounds for
North American waterfowl.18 As of 2009, the Alberta government had
granted permits allowing oil companies to divert 21 billion cubic
feet of water each year for their operations, an amount that is
about six times what is needed by a city of one million people for
one year.19 These water withdrawals threaten the sustainability of
fish populations and water- fowl nesting grounds.20

In situ tar sands drilling projects also consume great quan- tities
of water, some of which is taken from the Athabasca or other rivers,
but most of which is removed from local groundwater aquifers. These
projects pump steam under- ground, which condenses to form water
that is pumped back to the surface along with the bitumen. While
most of this water can be recycled, some remains stranded under-
ground, meaning that these projects are continually de- pleting
water resources. When shallower freshwater aqui- fers are used, the
continuous pumping of water can lower the water table and cause lakes
to shrink and wetlands to dry out. When deeper, saltier groundwater
is used, the tar sands operations must remove the salt, resulting in
large amounts of waste sludge that has to be taken to landfills or
injected underground.

toxic waste Tar sands mining operations produce huge amounts of
toxic waste, called "tailings." This waste consists of water, sand,
silt, clay, contaminants and hydrocarbons.21 Contami- nants in the
tailings include naphthenic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
phenolic compounds, ammonia, mercury and other trace metals.22

The mix of water and waste in tar sands tailings ponds is acutely toxic
to aquatic organisms and mammals.23 Accord- ing to the International
Agency for Research on Cancer, the National Toxicology Program and
the U.S. Environmental tAr SAndS 101

Many leaders of indigenous peoples, known in Canada as First Nations,
have denounced the tar sands industry for destroying forests and
limiting their abil- ity to hunt and fish in their traditional
territories. Residents of Fort Chipewyan, downstream of the largest
concentration of tar sands strip mining operations, report that they
can no longer drink the water or eat fish from the area, and they
suspect pollution from the tar sands is causing elevated rates of a
rare form of cancer. The First Nations also report that they were not
adequately con- sulted -- as required by their constitutional treaty
rights -- before these mam- moth operations were launched.

First Nations have been fighting back against this injustice. In 2008,
the Atha- basca Chipewyan and Mikisew Cree called for a moratorium on
tar sands de- velopment. That same year, the Beaver Lake Cree filed
suit against Canada and Alberta for violation of their treaty rights
relating to severe pollution of their territory. And in March 2010, a
coalition of 30 First Nations from British Colum- bia, whose lives and
livelihoods would be threatened by a proposed tar sands pipeline to the
Pacific coast, declared that "...tankers carrying crude oil from the
Alberta Tar Sands will not be allowed to transit our lands and waters."

Near Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, downstream from the tar sands.

Protection Agency, certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons have
been classified as definite, probable or possible cancer-causing
agents in humans. Because of this toxicity, the tailings waste cannot
be released directly back into the Athabasca River, and is instead
stored behind holding dams.

These toxic tailings ponds cover nearly 50 square miles, and are
increasing in volume at the rate of about 80 Olympic- sized swimming
pools each day.24 These dumps are an environmental threat because they
leak into the ground- water, with estimates suggesting that as much
as four bil- lion liters of tailings leak each year.25 The tailings
ponds also are a threat to migratory birds. For example, in the spring
of 2008, 1,600 migrating ducks were killed when they landed on one of
Syncrude's tailings ponds.26 Independent scien- tists have estimated
that the actual number of waterfowl deaths is far higher.27

ecosystem destruction: 32 million Acres The future 'footprint' of the
tar sands operations could eventually cover an area nearly the size
of Florida -- and oil companies have leased more than half of this
land already, lands that are held in public trust by the province of
Al- berta.

Canada's Boreal Forest is one of the most important forests in
the world. It represents one-quarter of the earth's remaining
intact forests and makes up 11% of the planet's terrestrial carbon
storehouses, not including its tundra and wetlands.28 Because
of its key role in carbon storage, Canada's Boreal region is a
life-support system for the planet. But instead of being protected
as an irreplaceable resource, it is un- der siege by these tar sands
strip- mining and drilling operations in Alberta.

The Boreal Forest is a complex ecosystem of forests, wetlands, and
lakes that are home to a wide variety of wildlife such as bears,
wolves, lynx, and some of the largest populations of woodland caribou
left in the world. Thirty percent of North America's songbirds and
40% of its waterfowl rely on critical habitat in the Boreal's lakes
and wetlands.

Nearly 2,000 square miles of this forest, spanning numerous
watersheds, could ultimately be strip-mined as a result of tar sands
oil development.29 Before strip-mining can begin, the forest must be
clear-cut, the wetlands drained, and riv- ers and streams diverted. By
2008, mining operations had already destroyed more than 200 square
miles of the Boreal Forest,30 and approved operations would strip-mine
an ad- ditional 360 square miles.31

Tar sands sites deemed suitable for in situ drilling span 52,800
square miles -- an area nearly 30 times as large as the strip-mineable
area. This massive scale of industrial de- velopment could push these
forests beyond recovery, lead- ing to irreversible ecological damage
and loss. Based on tar sands operations over the past three decades,
the United Nations Environment Program has identified Alberta's
tar sands mines as one of the world's key global "hotspots" of
environmental degradation.

While oil companies are obligated by law to reclaim their tar sands
operations, the track record to date and the mas- sive extent of
environmental degradation make success- ful restoration of the Boreal
Forest nearly impossible. Less than one percent of the 200 square
miles of land disturbed by tar sands mining operations thus far has
been certified by the government as reclaimed.32 The oil industry
has claimed that as much as 33 square miles have been reclaimed,
but have not shown that this area has met any reclamation standards
or guidelines.33 In addition, the toxic tailings ponds represent
an im- mense long-term reclamation challenge for the industry, as
no reclamation approach has been proven to successfully manage this
toxic waste.

At best, reclamation of the Boreal Forest from tar sands oil produc-

tion will be a large-scale experiment that has little hope of
re-creating a self-sustaining ecosystem anytime within the next
hundred years.

escalating carbon emissions Tar sands oil production is the fastest
growing source of global warming pollution in Canada.34 Tar sands
global warming pollution comes from the massive trucks and ma-
chines used to extract the bitumen, the natural gas burned to heat
the water to wash or melt the bitumen from the sand, and the energy
used to upgrade bitumen to synthet- ic crude oil and to refine the
synthetic crude oil to gasoline, diesel and other fuels. Just looking
at the extraction and upgrading processes, global warming pollution
is at least three times higher per barrel of tar sands synthetic crude
oil than for conventional crude oil produced in Canada and the United
States.35 This does not count the likely additional emissions resulting
from the soil disturbance and changes in wetlands and groundwater.36

In 2002, the Canadian government ratified the Kyoto Pro- tocol on
global warming, legally committing Canada to reducing the country's
global warming pollution by six per- cent below 1990 levels by
2012. But the rapid growth of tar sands operations, a powerful oil
industry and a sympathetic Canadian government have effectively
delayed action and allowed emissions to increase. In fact, Canada's
federal government has stood idly by and allowed Canada's global
warming pollution to increase to an astonishing 26 percent above 1990
levels.37 The most recent climate change plan released by the Canadian
government abandons its inter- national obligations altogether, and
would allow pollution from the tar sands to increase 69 percent by
2020.38 In addi- tion, regulations that would actually enforce this
plan have been repeatedly delayed.

empty Promises of carbon capture While the oil industry and Canadian
government alike are making big prom- ises about the use of carbon
capture and storage technology for tar sands, numerous studies have
demonstrated the limitations and high costs of this approach for
the tar sands. A report by the World Wildlife Federation and the
Co-operative Bank show that even the most optimistic estimates for
this tech- nology would fall far short of reducing tar sands emissions
to the levels of con- ventional oil production.39

Tar sands oil currently accounts for only about four percent of overall
U.S. oil use; however, if industry has its way, that portion is slated
to rise to ten or 15 percent. The United States could easily do without
tar sands oil, and the proposed rapid expansion of tar sands facilities
in the United States threatens com- munities in several ways:

Miles of pipelines would crisscross the Northern Plains, Midwest and
South, industrializing rural areas and bringing „ noise, traffic
and risks of pollution. Dozens of refineries proposed to process
dirty tar sands oil will bring toxic emissions and pollute air and
water. „ Construction of tar sands pipelines and refineries will
lock America into a dirty energy infrastructure and encourage the
„ nation's addiction to oil. The higher carbon footprint of tar
sands oil will lead to an increase in the U.S. transportation sector
emissions -- a sector „ that already accounts for one third of the
nation's global warming pollution.

America desperately needs to break its addiction to oil. Importing
tar sands oil from Canada continues dependence on oil and leaves
the country vulnerable to skyrocketing fuel costs, national security
threats, pollution, and environmental destruction.

Alberta Tar SandsThe tar sands represent around half of Canada's
total oil production.40

Over 99 percent of exported Western Canadian Crude goes to the United
States.41

Approximately 10 percent of u.S. crude oil is imported from Canada.42

Tar sands are about four percent of total U.S. oil consumption at
800,000 barrels per day as of 2008.

Alberta's oil exports -- over half of which are from the tar sands --
reach the United States through a network of more than 10,000 miles
of pipeline.43

The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would bring as much as 900,000
barrels a day to the Gulf Coast.

Producing a barrel of syn- thetic crude oil from tar sands emits at
least three times the global warming pollution as producing a barrel
of conventional oil, causing the tar sands to be the fastest growing
source of global warming pollution in Canada.

Pollution from refininG

There are approximately 150 oil refineries in the United States, and
many of the communities that host them are already subject to high
levels of pollution. Tar sands crude, with its higher concentration
of pollutants, will simply make this worse.44

Pollutants from refineries include, but are not limited to, air
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), car- bon
monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter,
and heavy metals, and discharges of ammonia and other chemicals into
water systems.

To date, most of the refining of tar sands oil in the United States
has been of limited volumes of synthetic crude oil (SCO). Many
oil refineries in the Midwest are being ex- panded and retrofitted
so they can process both additional SCO and raw bitumen from the
tar sands. These retrofits--- necessary to deal with this heavy,
sour crude---essentially involve adding upgraders to the refinery
facilities. Bitumen must be upgraded into SCO, and then SCO is refined
into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Bitumen
is very heavy and contains many impurities. 'Cracking' the bitumen to
make it lighter and removing the contaminants requires large inputs
of energy, with carbon dioxide, a key global warming pollutant,
being one of the main waste products.

What is so bad about upgrading Canadian tar sands oil? It is "heavy
sour" crude that contains more sulfur, nitrogen and metals (including
mercury, lead, nickel, and arsenic) than conventional crudes. In fact,
bitumen typically con- tains 2.5 percent more sulfur and four times the
nitrogen of conventional crude.45 These chemical differences result in
increased emissions of such pollutants as SO2, NOx, VOCs, and metals.

All of these pollutants are harmful to human health. Sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter all make people sick, causing
lung and respiratory problems such as bronchitis, asthma, respiratory
infections, and decreased lung function. Many metals such as mercury
are neuro- toxic; and some volatile organic compounds emitted by
refineries are carcinogenic.46 Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain,
and volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide create smog and haze.

While refineries are supposed to control any significant new pollution
generated by their expansions, they often radically underestimate
emissions due to faulty and inaccu- rate estimation tools borrowed from
completely different industries, or omit emission sources altogether
in their per- mit application calculations---especially those that
are not directly emitted from smokestacks. Emissions from flaring,
coking, venting, and "fugitive" sources such as leaky valves tend to
be among the most miscalculated.47

Simply put, refining tar sands oil requires more energy than
conventional oil because of the additional upgrading needed. As
a result, the refining process emits higher levels of greenhouse
gases. Importing tar sands will add to U.S. emissions.

Pipelines transport approximately 800,000 barrels of tar sands bitumen
and synthetic crude to the United States per day, mainly to refineries
in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. Operating these pipelines
and allowing construction of new and expanded tar sands pipelines
will present serious environmental risks to the land and water in
these areas. The largest of the proposed new pipelines will run around
2000 miles through the heartland of Amer- ica, in areas populated by
farmers, ranchers and Native Americans.48

Along their routes, heated soil and spills caused by the pipelines
threaten soil quality and productivity. For

 example, soil temperatures near the TransCanada Keystone pipeline
 which runs through the Dakotas, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and
 Oklahoma will be elevated by around 2°F from late December through
 late August, and by as much as 5°F in early March, when the pipeline
 is running at its full capacity of 591,000 barrels per day. This may
 cause a decrease in soil moisture content, which would hurt farmers
 who use their land for pro- duction agriculture.49

Underground pipelines, including the crude oil pipelines currently
being proposed and built, are not immune to leaks and spills, and in
fact, their leaks would go directly into the soil without having to
pen- etrate vegetation and surface lay- ers. Because of the imperfect
leak detection mechanism, small leaks can be present for as much
as three months and penetrate multiple lay- ers of soil before being
detected. Catastrophic leaks or ruptures are detected far more quickly,
but even in just a few minutes, can involve thousands of barrels of
oil.50 Since 1973, Enbridge, a pipeline company currently building
tar sands oil pipe- lines in the United States, has been responsible
for over four million gallons of hazardous liquids (primar- ily crude
oil) spilled from pipelines; between 2003 and 2008, Enbridge pipeline
accidents were responsible for 13 fatalities, 29 injuries and $633

million in property damage.51

These pipelines often run through shal- low aquifers; it is of little
help that a pipeline company can detect the leak and shut the pipeline
down within the first several hours -- the leak will already have
infiltrated and contaminated the aquifer. A proposed tar sands oil
pipeline called Keystone XL will run through the Ogalalla Aquifer --
also known as the High Plains aquifer -- in the Great Plains. Ap-

lies above this aquifer system, and 30 percent of the ground water
used for irrigation comes from this source. Furthermore, the High
Plains aquifer provides drinking water to 82 percent of the people
who live within its border.52

Pipeline companies want us to imagine that pipelines sit quietly
underground, and that oil flows easily through them from Canada
to refineries in the Midwest and other parts of the United States,
re- quiring only the help of gravity, and per- haps a small amount
of assistance from pumps. The reality is, however, that tar sands
pipelines need fossil fuel-consum- ing pumping stations along their
length to keep the heavy oil moving through. If tar sands exports to
the United States were to increase to three million barrels per day,
as some industry experts have predicted, the carbon dioxide emissions
from the pipeline transportation alone would be equivalent to the
emissions from over one million passenger cars.53

**Climate Security and Energy Security Must Go Hand in Hand**

...we cannot pursue energy independence by taking steps that would
con- tradict our emerging climate policy. Energy security and a sound
response to climate change cannot be achieved by pursuing more fossil
fuels. Our nation requires diversification of energy sources and a
serious commitment to renewable energy. Not simply for environmental
reasons -- for national security reasons."

-- Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, Testimony to Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Hearing on "Climate Change and Global Security: Challenges,

Threats, and Global Opportunities." Washington, DC. July 21, 2009

Hurricane Katrina was a sign of the terrible insecurity climate
change can cause. Tar sands oil exacerbates climate change and the
severe storms associated with it. Yet tar sands cannot provide oil
supply in case of disruption such as that caused by Katrina, be-
cause the industry carries no spare production capacity.

chapter 3 exPenSive oil And the myth of enerGy Security

Canadian officials and oil executives claim that tar sands oil is
a boon to U.S. energy security because it comes from a neighboring
country friendly to the United States.

Scratching the surface of this claim reveals that, in reality, tar
sands oil cannot substantially enhance energy security be- cause it
is too expensive and there isn't enough of it. In fact, tar sands oil
presents a risk to American energy security be- cause it perpetuates
oil addiction and requires resources that could be devoted to new,
clean energy projects that would create jobs.

Seven reASonS why tAr SAndS cAn- not enhAnce u.S. enerGy Security
tar sands cannot break the power of oPec. 1. The oil cartel, the
Organization of the Petroleum Ex- porting Countries (OPEC), controls
the world market for oil, and this will remain true with or without tar
sands. The International Energy Agency forecasts show that OPEC's share
of the market is set to increase with or without tar sands growth.54
Even if the United States were to greatly increase its consumption
of tar sands oil, it would not change the dynamic of the market or
challenge OPEC control.

tar sands are expensive. 2. Oil from tar sands is among the most
expensive on earth because it re- quires enormous amounts of energy
to extract and extra processes to refine. Tar sands oil is only
profitable when gas prices are high. In fact, the industry cannot be
profitable in a world of low or volatile prices. If you are putting
tar sands in your tank, it's because gas prices are high. We cannot
drill or mine our way to low gas prices because oil prices are
set on the world market. If the United States produces more, OPEC,
which controls more than 75% of world's proved oil reserves and 44%
of global production, will simply decrease its output commensurately.55
The total oil supply will remain es- sentially the same and the price
of fuel will continue to increase unless we get off oil. Tar sands
oil represents a tiny drop in the bucket on the world oil market,
and is not worth the costs to for- ests, water, and human health.

tar sands cannot help if there is an embargo, 3. climate event or armed
conflict that disrupts oil shipments. Because of huge infrastructure
and capital investments, it takes years for tar sands projects to
come on-line and the industry carries no spare ca- pacity. During the
so-called tar sands boom between 2003 and 2008, tar sands producers
spent five years and $50 billion raising tar sands production a mere
350,000 barrels a day.56 By comparison, Hurricane Ka- trina knocked
out 367,000 barrels a day of production in a single day.57

tar sands are not needed for rising u.S. oil 4. consumption, because
(good news!) u.S. oil consumption is not rising. There is a myth
that U.S. oil demand will rise for decades, but the good news is
that oil consumption is expected to decline. All major forecasts
now agree that U.S. oil demand has peaked and will level off under
existing regulations aimed at tackling oil consumption.58 Moreover,
many forecasts have yet to take into account the full transfor-
mational potential of hybrids, electric cars, and other efficiency
measures such as smart growth planning that could vastly reduce
U.S. oil consumption.59 With policies that encourage this reduction,
there will be no need for tar sands oil, and much of the predicted
rise in tar sands production will not materialize.

tar Sands impede the transition to cleaner
5. technologies. Occasionally, one hears the argu- ment that while
tar sands are dirty, our clean energy future is still years away,
and we need this oil in the meantime. This argument has several
flaws. First, ex- acerbating oil addiction cannot logically be the
way toward breaking that addiction. Second, tar sands infrastructure
projects last 30 years or more. That's a long bridge. Third, investing
billions in tar sands infra- structure puts cleaner technologies at a
disadvantage for decades to come as investors must recoup the enormous
sunk costs of that infrastructure. Efficiency can save more oil than
tar sands can provide. Efficiency is the solution to our oil addiction.

tar Sands projects in the united States will 6. not hinder chinese
access. Some Canadian com- mentators have threatened that if the
United States does not buy tar sands oil, then Canada will sell to
Chi- na. This is an empty threat as there is no current way to get tar
sands oil to China. The proposed Gateway pipeline which would take tar
sands from Alberta to the west coast of Canada is not certain. Such
a pipeline would have to cross dozens of First Nation territories,
defy a de facto tanker ban, and overcome the deter- mined resistance
of activists in British Columbia and across Canada.

Further, the industry wants "both/and," not "either/ or" and intends
to meet both markets with its growth plans. In addition, it is
possible that the Keystone XL pipeline may be used to deliver tar
sands oil to the international shipping ports on the Gulf Coast as
op- posed to serving the U.S. market. However, with global demand for
oil flattening, it is far from clear that the market will support tar
sands growth at this level.60 U.S. abstinence from tar sands oil will
retard the industry's growth. A reduction in U.S. oil demand allows
other countries to meet demand without resorting to tar sands oil.

tar Sands do not prevent the dynamic of 7. "peak oil." Tar sands
growth -- even reckless and rapid growth -- cannot keep pace with
future declines in conventional oil production. The good news is that
through transformational technologies such as the electric car, we
can make "peak demand" drive lower prices, instead of "peak supply"
driving higher ones.

**Fear is the Oil Industry's Friend**

Tar sands proponents who market the myth of energy security are hoping
that U.S. policy makers will be frightened into accepting tar sands
growth. However, expanding reliance on tar sands oil, as with any
oil, perpetuates American strategic and economic vulnerability. The
best investments in energy security are those that reduce oil demand
and dependence.

**Reliance on fossil fuels harms national security:** " U.S. dependence
on fossil fuels undermines economic stability, which is critical to
national security."

---Center for Naval Analysis Military Advisory Board (Powering
America's Defense, 2009)

**We must free ourselves from oil:** " Our dependence on oil -- not
just foreign oil -- reduces our leverage internationally and sometimes
limits our options. I say all oil, because we simply do not have enough
resources in this country to free us from the stranglehold of those who
do. We find ourselves entangled with unfriendly rulers and undemocratic
nations simply because we need their oil. And we cannot produce enough
oil to change this dynam- ic -- we have to wean ourselves from it."

---Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, Testimony to Senate Foreign Relations
Committee

A riSky inveStment

The financial attractiveness of tar sands projects depend on several
increasingly tenuous assumptions: that high oil prices will be sus-
tained over the very long life of the projects; that social and envi-
ronmental costs will be minimal and not lead to costly delays; that
breakthrough, transformational technologies will be achieved at an
affordable price (e.g., carbon capture and sequestration); and that
the projects will maintain their continued social license to operate.

As the most expensive source of oil in the world, the tar sands
are uniquely vulnerable to low oil prices. Before the price of oil
plunged in 2008, the tar sands were the world's largest industrial
project. Companies had planned to spend as much as $125 billion to
expand operations toward the goal of tripling oil production over
the next 10 to 15 years. Between oil's price drop in July 2008 and
June 2009, 85% of deferred or cancelled non-OPEC production capacity
was located in the tar sands. Overall spending was cut in half during
this period, which Canada's federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice
dubbed a "de facto moratorium."

There is only a small price window at which tar sands projects are
recognized to be economically viable. Financial analysts and indus-
try players including Goldman Sachs and Total have said that tar
sands projects require long-term prices in excess of $80/barrel to
break even. Given the long capital horizons involved in the tar sands,
oil prices need to remain consistently high for decades in order for
projects to earn a return. Deutsche Bank and BP, among others, have
raised doubts recently about the long-term oil demand and have pre-
dicted that global demand will peak in the next 10-20 years.

Some in the oil and gas industry are already beginning to acknowl-
edge the risks associated with the tar sands and shift capital toward
shorter term, less carbon-intensive opportunities. Relative to tar
sands, these new opportunities have low costs and fast payback ho-
rizons. Shell Oil has significantly scaled back its tar sands plans,
and Nexen has said that it is waiting for carbon-price certainty
before ex- panding its tar sands exposure. _____________

At a time when the country is embracing a new, clean energy economy,
it doesn't make sense to suggest that America now needs a dirtier,
more expensive source of oil -- a source that we have made do without
for years. It is in the U.S. national interest to stop the expansion
of Canada's tar sands oil de- velopment as part of efforts to fight
global warming through reducing the emissions of the transportation
sector. Working together, the government, citizens and private sector
can stop the progression of this massive dirty oil project and help
keep America on its clean energy path.

There are a number of policy solutions that can help Canada to
clean up existing tar sands operations and stop the indus- try's
reckless expansion. Policies and incentives for clean fuels and
healthy transportation solutions will reduce U.S. demand for tar sands
oil. Although the consequences of destroying the Boreal Forest, one of
the world's largest carbon storehouses, are felt by everyone, currently
the oil industry is not being held accountable for its actions. They
are passing the costs of their mining operations on to our children and
our children's children. Policies and decisions that make tar sands
oil compa- nies bear the full weight of their environmental impacts
will provide incentives to clean up the tar sands oil operations.

Furthermore, a federal government decision that the United States
does not need yet another tar sands pipeline slicing through America's
agricultural heartland would show that tar sands oil is not the path
that Americans choose. Companies that pur- chase fuel for their
transportation needs are already starting to say no to tar sands
oil. The following solutions can help America reach its goal of
reducing its reliance on oil, including the much dirtier and more
expensive oil from the Canadian tar sands.

Six SolutionS to helP AmericAnS reduce reliAnce on oil, includinG
cAnAdiAn tAr SAndS

chapter 4 StoPPinG the tAr SAndS invASion

Solution 1: Stop expansion of tar sands oil production in canada. The
United States should send a clear message to the oil industry and
the Canadian government that the environ- mental and public health
cost of tar sands oil production is too high. Existing tar sands oil
operations need to be cleaned up, and the oil companies need to bear
the full costs of this work. Expansion of tar sands oil production
is not environmentally healthy and not economically neces- sary at
a time when we are building a clean energy econo- my in the United
States and Canada.

Solution 2: build no more tar sands pipelines and refineries in
the united States. The United States should not lock itself into an
expensive and polluting pipeline and refinery infrastructure. Such
an infrastructure will make it even harder to reduce depen- dence on
oil in the long-term.

The United States should not permit tar sands pipe- „ lines that
would bring even more tar sands oil from Alberta to the United
States. The United States should conduct a comprehensive re- „
view of whether this expansion of tar sands oil imports into the
United States is consistent with the nation's commitments to curb
climate change and to build a clean energy economy. State and federal
government permits for these refin- „ eries should be held to the
highest standard for water, air and greenhouse gas pollution.

State and federal governments should not provide fi- „ nancial
subsidies for tar sands oil refinery construction. Companies and
governments as purchasers of fuel „ should not support expansion
of existing upgrading/ refining operations in the United States
and should oppose construction of new refineries for tar sands oil,
such as the proposed new Hyperion refinery in South Dakota. The United
States should not allow the proposed „ Alaska natural gas pipeline,
meant to bring natural gas to the United States, to be diverted
to fuel tar sands extraction in Alberta. Using this natural gas to
fuel tar sands oil production would result in increasing rather than
decreasing global warming emissions.

Solution 3: reduce demand for oil as a transpor- tation
fuel. Ninety-five percent of the energy used for U.S. transporta-
tion comes from petroleum, and transportation accounts for 71 percent
of U.S. consumption of petroleum prod- ucts -- with most of that
consumption used for personal transportation.61 The United States can
dramatically cut oil consumption by reinforcing existing reduction
programs, such as efficiency standards for vehicles, and through
new investments in alternatives to oil. The oil savings achievable
with some of these policies are shown in the Clean Energy Saves Oil
chart below.

Comprehensive clean energy policies could achieve oil savings of
four million barrels per day within ten years. These savings would
be realized through a combination of higher efficiency new cars and
trucks, maximizing the fuel economy of existing vehicles through
technologies such as fuel efficient tires and motor oil, advanced
and environmentally sustainable biofuels, smart growth and transit,
electric cars, air travel improvements, and energy conservation
measures in buildings. From 2010 to 2020, the United States would save
approximately $940 billion in oil purchases compared to a business
as usual scenario where vehicle efficiency and clean fuel volumes
remained at today's levels. These measures to save oil can be achieved
through a clean energy policy strategy that combines a cap on carbon
emissions, vehicle and fuel greenhouse gas performance standards,
and investment in new transporta- tion technologies and infrastructure.

At the national level, set specific targets for reducing „ U.S. use
of oil within specific timeframes and set out an integrated plan
for reaching those goals through a mix of legislative and regulatory
actions. Increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles beyond „
2016. Provide further incentives for electrification of trans- „
portation, including rail, public transit, and vehicles. Reduce vehicle
miles traveled through support for public „ transportation, rail,
land use planning and smart growth initiatives. Accelerate oil savings
in industrial, aviation and resi- „ dential building sectors. Put
in place a national low carbon fuel standard that „ steadily reduces
the carbon intensity of fuels over time, includes full fuel cycle and
indirect land use emissions, and distinguishes between conventional
and uncon- ventional fossil fuel sources. Provide further incentives
for production of environ- „ mentally sustainable biofuels. Provide
publicly verifiable tracking of greenhouse gas „ emissions and
tracking of unconventional fuels move- ment from source to refinery.

Solution 4: don't spend taxpayer dollars on tar sands oil. The
United States already has a law in place that prevents spending
taxpayer dollars on fuels that are worse for cli- mate change than
conventional oil. Tar sands oil is one of these dirtier fuels. Section
526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA)
should continue to include tar sands oil. The United States should
expand this fuel pro- curement policy across all federal government
agencies so that tar sands oil is included, as was intended by the
legis- lation. Implementation of this section should also consider
all upstream tar sands emissions, as omitting them will un- fairly
disadvantage homegrown, environmentally sustain- able transportation
solutions.

Solution 5: eliminate tar sands oil subsidies and financing. Subsidies
and financial incentives that benefit tar sands oil imports have been
embedded in broader legislation and policies. In September 2009,
President Obama pledged to work with his colleagues at the G20 to
phase out fossil fuel subsidies in order to better address the climate
chal- lenge.62 To achieve this commitment, existing tax subsidies
should be repealed, including the Internal Revenue Code Section
179C refinery expensing option for tar sands and oil shale. Other
subsidy proposals for high-carbon fuels such as tar sands oil have
included long term government procurement contracts, grant funding,
favorable tax treat- ment, loans and loan guarantees. Any existing
high-carbon fuel subsidies should be eliminated and the United States
should refrain from enacting new ones.

Solution 6: Adopt corporate policies that say no to tar sands oil. The
U.S. corporate sector has considerable influence, both with federal
and state governments and with suppliers of transportation services
and fuels. By adopting low carbon transportation policies and shifting
their transportation spending away from suppliers of high-carbon fuels
such as those derived from tar sands oil, the corporate sector can help
curb the expansion of tar sands oil. For example, in February 2010,
Whole Foods Market and Bed, Bath & Beyond both announced that they
would encourage their transportation providers to avoid high impact
fuels such as those from refineries using tar sands oil and would
work to eliminate tar sands fuel from their supply.63 In addition,
the U.S. corporate sector can encourage federal and state gov-
ernments to take similar actions.

The United States already has a law in place that pre- vents spending
taxpayer dol- lars on fuels that are worse for climate change than con-
ventional oil. Tar sands oil is one of these dirtier fuels.

America is a land of innovators. And today the factories of Detroit,
the laboratories of Silicon Valley and the next generation of American
consumers are ready to invest in and profit from clean technol-
ogy. Almost every major car maker in the world is coming out with an
electric vehicle, and cost benefit analyses show that these vehicles
will reduce the cost of fuel. More importantly, these vehicles are
the transformational technology that will finally reduce strategic
dependence on oil, thus making the nation more secure.

As simple as this way forward appears, it is being threatened by
the powerful interests of the oil lobby and certain arms of the
Canadian government. The oil industry does not want to give up the
record profits they have enjoyed. In 2009, the oil industry spent $154
million just on lobbying the U.S. Congress -- not including all of the
millions they spent on advertis- ing.64 Recognizing that conventional
oil supplies are decreasing, the giants of the oil industry --
including Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Conoco-Philips --
have partnered with influential arms of the Canadian government to
lobby for in- creased U.S. use of tar sands oil. They are willing
to sacrifice the largest remaining carbon storehouse in the world --
our planet's very ability to cope with CO2 emissions -- for the chance
to make themselves rich. The tar sands battle is about profit at the
expense of climate security.

Over the past several years, tens of thousands of people have come
together from all over the world to protest the tar sands. Yet without
the support of the Obama Administration and the U.S. Congress, the
oil industry will win. While the tar sands oil industry benefits
from increasingly expensive gasoline, Canadian and American citizens
will be left to deal with a network of pollution and a planet that
is increasingly unable to deal with global warming.

This report has outlined the dangers of the tar sands. We call on you,
our reader, to consider the costs:

Tar sands are a global disaster, because they will all but guarantee
the failure of efforts to combat global warming. „ Tar sands weaken
U.S. energy security by continuing our dependence on oil, in this
case the dirtiest and most expen- „ sive form of oil. Tar sands
operations violate the legal rights of indigenous people, and harm the
health of people living in communi- „ ties downstream from those
operations. Tar sands directly compete with homegrown jobs in clean
energy and may take away opportunities for America to „ transition
to an independent energy sector.

All forecasts agree that U.S. demand for oil has peaked and will soon
decline. With a little help from efficiency measures, hybrids and
fully electric cars, oil use can decrease dramatically in the next
few years. Oil will remain, for some time, a sig- nificant part of
the fuel mix, but America does not need an expansion of tar sands oil,
especially when the environmental and public health costs are so high.

The United States can maintain mobility, while at the same time acting
to halt expansion of expensive and dirty fuels that cause global
warming and so many other environmental and health impacts. The
solutions lie in clean, renewable fuel sources, energy efficient
technology and smart growth.
