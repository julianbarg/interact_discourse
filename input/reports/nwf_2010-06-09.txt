**Tar sands extraction facilities in Alberta, Canada**

British Petroleum's Deepwater

Horizon tragedy off the Louisiana coast, which killed 11 men and
is an unfolding ecological disaster, is not an argument to expand
Canadian tar sands development, as some have argued. The Gulf Coast
catastrophe should instead propel us away from a future of diminishing
returns and higher costs from "unconventional"

fossil fuel extraction, which includes tar sands, oil shale and
coal-to-liquids.

Moving deeper into tar sands would be taking the country down the
wrong path---one that leads to an inevitable

The tar sands industry aims to create an extensive web of pipelines
to deliver increasing amounts of this

Canadian tar sands sludge to refineries in the United States. The
U.S. federal government has already approved two dedicated tar sands
pipelines and is poised to approve a third. The

Canadian company Enbridge's Alberta

Clipper pipeline, running from the

U.S.---Canadian border in North Dakota,

and across Minnesota to Wisconsin,

has already been completed.

TransCanada's Keystone I pipeline,

which the State Department approved in 2009, runs from Alberta to
Illinois and on to Oklahoma. TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL
pipeline is the third pipeline whose permit application is currently
being reviewed by the U.S.

State Department. It would cut through America's heartland, running
nearly 2,000 miles from Alberta down to Port Arthur, Texas, where
the tar sands will be refined into transportation fuels.3 Other,
shorter pipelines are envisioned to run to refineries around the
country. This network of tar sands pipelines would deliver even more
pollution to refineries where and the surrounding communities, which
are already experiencing health effects.4

The proposed Keystone XL pipeline will traverse rivers and carve across
prairies, will flow on top of vital aquifers, and threaten farmers,

ranchers and wildlife when it leaks or breaks, as it unquestionably
will.

Building this new pipeline would institutionalize a demand for a
product that we do not need---especially if we seize the initiative
to wean ourselves from this a fuel that is sullying our coasts,
tearing up our heartland, and destroying the health and livelihoods of
communities. Current projections are that the new pipeline would not
even run close to capacity, raising the question of why the U.S. is
even considering this project.5

Promoting the growth of the

Canadian tar sands industry is a dangerous and foolhardy development.

This pipeline system would virtually assure the destruction of swaths
of one of the world's most important forest ecosystems, produce
lake-sized reservoirs of toxic waste, import a thick, tarlike fuel
that will release vast quantities of toxic chemicals into our air when
it is refined in the U.S., and emit significantly more global warming
pollutants into the atmosphere than fuels made from conventional oil.

Communities that live near the tar sands are already experiencing
health problems linked to the pollution, and dozens of wildlife
species are at risk,

including millions of migrating cranes,

swans, and songbirds. If Keystone XL

crosses our border, it will cut through thousands of miles of sensitive
habitat in America's heartland. When the tar sands are refined in
U.S. facilities, the

Persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to be
physically, psychologically, or socially harmful; the state of being
enslaved to a habit or practice.

resulting pollution will foul our air and

We believe that the U. S. needs clean and renewable energy solutions
as we make the inevitable and necessary transition to a post-oil
world. Tar sands, as well as other inferior fossil fuels like oil
shale, simply should not be part of the equation. Tar sands are a
starkly inefficient, polluting,

ecologically disastrous and expensive way to power our cars and
trucks. Each tar sands pipeline our government approves further
increases our dependence on this dirty fuel. These pipelines will
become, in effect, a long-

term, government-approved pollution delivery system.

If we allow all these pipelines to be built, we are essentially saying
that we are willing to feed our oil habit, even if we know it will
harm our air, water,

health, prosperity and planet. Agreeing to increase our imports of
Canadian tar sands represents the worst kind of addictive behavior:
"persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to by
physically,

psychologically, or socially harmful."

Why then, we ask in this report, is the U.S. poised to allow this
expanded pipeline network that will lock our country into an ongoing
reliance on the dirtiest of fossil fuels?

It is time to apply every ounce of

American ingenuity to finding a technological path to a future that
relies far less on oil and other fossil fuels and far more on sources
of fuel that are renewable, sustainable, and clean. By applying the
talent and technology of America's best minds and businesses, this
country can dramatically improve our environment and accelerate our
move beyond a dirty energy economy.

We have arrived at a critical crossroads that will determine whether
we can break free from this dependence---or lash ourselves tighter
to it. Building new pipelines to import billions of barrels of dirty
fuel from

Canada is taking the wrong path into increasingly hazardous terrain. We
should tell our elected leaders to reconsider.**TOP 5 REASONS NOT TO

**TAR SANDS DEVELOPMENT**

An aerial view of the area around Fort

McMurray, Alberta, provides a stark portrait of an addiction. The

Athabasca River, snaking through a region once marked by unending
vistas of glowing green conifers and populated by woodland caribou,

moose, bears and lynx, now demarcates ground zero for what is arguably
the most destructive peacetime industrial activity in the history
of mankind.

Tar sands development has transformed a landscape of boreal forest
and peat lands into a vast oil sacrifice zone. On either side of the
river, a series of giant open pit mines,

belching processing facilities, and poisonous tailings ponds now
line the floodplains and wetlands. The giant toxic tailings ponds
have grown large enough to see from space.

Even more troubling, the industrial activity is poised to spread
across the landscape like blight. If all the current

Canadian tar sands leases are exploited, development is slated to
encompass an area the size of New

York and New Jersey combined.

The Canadian tar sands industry is,

by almost any measure, one of the most wasteful and polluting
industries humanity has ever invented. Over the past ten years,
commercial tar sands production became increasingly profitable because
of rising oil prices and massive infrastructure construction that
accelerated the development's expanding reach. In pursuit of profits
that increased with the scaled-up production, energy companies have
torn up a province,

released countless gallons of toxic sludge into waterways, emitted
hundreds of millions of tons of global warming pollutants into the
atmosphere, and produced billions of barrels of viscous, heavy oil
that requires vast amounts of energy to transport and refine into a
transportation fuel.

**EXTRACTING BITUMEN**

Locked in underground pockets of sand, clay and water, tar sands
contain bitumen, which is a heavy, black viscous oil that can be
extracted,

upgraded, refined, and turned into fuel. The Canadian Energy Research

Institute estimates that these tar sands contain 1.7 trillion barrels
of heavy crude, of which approximately

173 billion barrels are recoverable.6

About 20 percent of Alberta's tar sands deposit is close enough to
the surface to be dug up using conventional open pit mining

**Vital wildlife habitat in the boreal forest is threatened when tar

removing millions of tons of earth.**

the most wasteful and polluting industries humanity has ever invented.*

techniques.7 Using this method, the forest is clear-cut and giant
open pit mines carve the layers of tar sands from the earth. These tar
sands are trucked to facilities where they are heated into a liquid,
and the bitumen is separated from the sand and clay.

This process requires substantial amounts of water and energy, and
leaves behind a number of toxic byproducts.

Another technique, known as *in situ*

production, will be used to target the other 80 percent of tar sands
deposits, located deeper in the ground. *In situ* production requires
companies to insert pipes into the ground, which are filled with steam
to heat up the tar sands and liquify the bitumen. This liquid bitumen
is then pumped to the surface much like conventional oil. Although this
technique does not result in the same wholesale habitat destruction
as strip mines, industry claims that *in situ*

mining is a "solution" for tar sands'

environmental problems is overstated.8 This process requires
substantially more energy than conventional mining, leaving a much
larger carbon footprint. *In situ* mining also fragments the landscape
with roads and pumping stations, requires large amounts of water,
and still leaves toxic tailings ponds during the upgrading process.

Both open pit mining and *in situ*

processes require systems of roads,

pads, industrial facilities and tailings ponds that all contribute to
the fragmentation and destruction of the boreal forest. The tailings
ponds---

which are more like giant toxic lakes filled with pollutants like
benzene,

cyanide, and mercury---stretch across the landscape, threatening
human health and wildlife.

**THREATENING DOWNRIVER**

**COMMUNITIES**

Scientists already have catalogued human health problems among the

First Nations people who live downriver.9 Studies have raised alarms
about increased cancer rates and autoimmune diseases. In the Fort

Chipewyan First Nation, where subsistence hunting and fishing is
still prevalent, hunters say they have noticed big changes in the
game they harvest--including the fact that moose livers are enlarged
and white-spotted.

Water from the Athabasca River, their main water source, now leaves
brown residue in the pot when they boil it.

Fish they depend on are contaminated with high levels of mercury and
toxic cancer-causing chemicals.

Because the communities in the vicinity of the mining sites are small,

there has been relatively little monitoring of how much the industrial
activity has affected human and wildlife health. What is clear is
that the process of extracting, upgrading,

and refining tar sands requires a suite of chemicals and produces
toxic byproducts.

**DELIVERY TO THE U.S.**

Much the tar sands upgrading to date has taken place in Alberta, but
the refining capacity is not high enough for the projected increase in
production. That is why the tar sands industry is proposing pipelines
to the

U.S.: to bring the unrefined heavy crude to refineries in the U.S.

Today, approximately 60 percent of

Canadian tar sands fuel is exported to the U.S. Our nation currently
imports about 800,000 barrels of this fuel a day, and some project
that this could increase fivefold if all the planned pipelines are
constructed, world oil supply from conventional oil dwindles,

and global demand intensifies.

In Canada, concern and opposition has been rising as the ecological
fallout from tar sands production becomes more visible. If the
U.S. continues its voracious oil habit and builds these pipelines
to support it, we will be contributing to this Canadian calamity for
many years to come.

**Polluted tailings ponds like this one are commonplace in tar sands
extraction and kill thousands of wildlife every year.**

**A DESTRUCTIVE BUSINESS**

The video footage is heartbreaking: a mallard drake, flapping its
wings in muck and beak dripping black gunk,

barely keeping afloat in oil sludge.10

No, not Alaska after the infamous

Exxon Valdez spill, or the Gulf Coast wetlands after the BP
explosion. It is the result of "normal" tar sands development in
Alberta.

Scientists are only beginning to understand the extent of the impacts
of Alberta tar sands production on the fish, waterfowl, and forest
animals that live in the remote boreal forest that has become
the hub of industrial tar sands production. Habitat destruction
and fragmentation is expanding rapidly, and even energy companies
acknowledge that they are effectively destroying habitat as they
go. In a recent report by Cambridge

Energy Research Associates,11 the authors quote the energy giant
Shell describing the impacts in an application for a mine expansion:

"Effectively, a complete loss of soil and terrain, terrestrial
vegetation,

wetlands and forest resources, wildlife and biodiversity happens for
this area for the period of operations."

This kind of large-scale habitat destruction raises even larger
concerns, because there is so much at stake in this fecund northern
wilderness.

The surrounding forest is home to the full complement of wildlife
any sportsman would imagine living in the

Canadian wilderness: bears, wolves,

lynx, and important herds of woodland caribou. The Athabasca River is
part of a vital nesting and staging ground for migratory waterfowl,
many of which winter in the continental U.S.

The Canadian boreal forest provides breeding, nesting or migration
stops for more than 300 species of birds---

including several species of cranes,

shorebirds, and more than a million inland birds.12

**FULL IMPACTS UNKNOWN**

Scientists know very little about the cumulative impacts of tar sands
development, says Canadian ecologist

Kevin Timoney, because the Canadian government, provincial authorities,

and energy companies have not conducted adequate monitoring and
testing. Timoney however, has begun documenting a series of harmful
effects to wildlife from habitat fragmentation, toxic exposures,
and other threats to wildlife.

Some of these effects have gained public notice. In 2008, 1,600 ducks
perished when they landed in a tar sands mine tailings pond operated by

Syncrude. Originally, the company downplayed the numbers, and it took
several years and a prosecution to bring the extent of the damage to
light. A lawsuit is pending against

Timoney estimates that even 1,600

substantially underestimates bird mortality from this event---and many
others that remain undocumented. In an article published in the Open

Conservation Biology *Journal*,

Timoney laid out a disturbing case that tar sands development has
led to a permanent loss of at least 58,000

birds---and possibly as many as

The Syncrude tailings pond deaths were the result of the birds becoming
mired in oil, despite companies' efforts to shoo birds away from their
toxic tailings ponds using noise cannons and scarecrows. The Cambridge

Energy Research Report states that,

"the surface layer of bitumen found

**Thousands upon thousands of ducks and other waterfowl die every

on most tailings ponds is an acute threat to wildlife."

Timoney says there are other dangers as well. He and others have
documented at least 43 other bird species---waterfowl and shore birds,

birds of prey and gulls---that have died from tar sands-related
development.

Timoney also made a Freedom of

Information and Protection of Privacy request of the Alberta
Sustainable

Resources Development, which disclosed that 27 black bears, 67 deer,

31 red foxes, 21 coyotes and unspecified numbers of moose,

muskrats, beavers, voles, martens,

wolves and bats had also perished on tar sands operations between 2000

Even more disturbing, Timoney discovered that those reported
numbers came from the energy companies themselves, suggesting an
under-reporting of some significance.

"The numbers of dead animals reported to government," he wrote,

"underestimated true mortality because they were derived from ad hoc
reporting by companies rather than from a scientifically valid and
statistically robust sampling design."

In another study, Timoney analyzed data from government and industry
sources that revealed strong evidence of chemical contamination in the

Athabasca River. Specifically, the levels of known cancer-causing
chemicals were as high as in industrial zones in the United
States. Elevated levels of mercury and other heavy metals were also
present. A government report from the Regional Aquatics Monitoring

Program determined that more than seven percent of river fish showed
growth abnormalities, which Timoney says is "high."

**AN EXPANDING THREAT**

There is every reason to believe this problem will only
worsen. According to

Environmental Defense Canada, tar sands tailings ponds already have a
surface area of 50 square miles, twice the size of Manhattan. These
contaminated tailings ponds have already leaked into the nearby
waterways, and projections are they will triple in size.

This spells more trouble for wildlife,

especially migrating birds. According to Colleen Cassady St. Clair and

Robert Ronconi from the University of

Alberta's Faculty of Science, "spring migration is a particular
problem in northeastern Alberta, when the warm-

water waste from oil sands mines are the only open water---the natural
bodies are still frozen. When waterfowl land in these ponds, they
may ingest oil and their plumage may become oiled with waste bitumen,
potentially preventing birds from flying or leading to lost insulation
and death from hypothermia."14

Even though there has been very little study of the effects of
tar sands development on wildlife, the indications are that this
development is releasing a potentially devastating onslaught on
Canadian and internationally-migrating animals. As ecologist Timoney
put it: "The effects of these pollutants on ecosystem and pubic
health deserve immediate and systematic study. Projected tripling of
tar sands activities over the next decade may result in unacceptably
large and unforeseen impacts of biodiversity, ecosystem function,
and public health. The attention of the world's scientific community
is urgently needed."

The only feasible way to transport large quantities of heavy oil to
the U.S.

is through pipelines. The current

Keystone I and Alberta Clipper pipelines are not yet filled to
capacity,

and critics say that additional capacity may not even be necessary
for years, if

Now, TransCanada has proposed building a new 2,000-mile-long pipeline
to carry heavy crude to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The

Keystone XL project would wend through Montana, South Dakota,

Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and

This three-foot diameter pipeline expansion is projected to carry as
much as 900,000 barrels a day of thick crude oil under high pressure.21

The current proposal asks for exemptions from existing law that
would lower the standard for pipeline safety to allow thinner pipe,
a detail that worries many residents whose land will be traversed by
the pipeline.

At public meetings in rural communities along the pipeline corridor
route, hundreds of citizens have expressed dismay and concern at the
process. They have raised unanswered questions about safety,

fairness, jobs, tax revenue, and the thoroughness of the environmental
assessment. Concerns include how the pipelines will be managed in
case of spills, whether landowners will be responsible for damages,
and the feasibility of building and maintaining a stable and safe
pipeline above critical aquifers and near lakes and rivers.

What follows are two voices from the pipelines' front lines.

On Ben Gotschall's family ranch in the

Sandhills region of Nebraska, the water table is so close to the
surface that the family simply sticks pipes into the ground to form
artesian wells. They don't need pumps or windmills; the clean water
bubbles to the surface from the Ogalalla Aquifer underneath. For the
Gotschalls and most of the state of

Nebraska, not to mention the seven other states where water needs
are supplied by this massive, underground pool of water, the Ogalalla
is about as important as anything gets. The aquifer feeds the mixed
grass prairies where

Gotschall grazes his cows, provides drinking water for two million
people,

and waters more than a quarter of the irrigated land in the U.S. The
water, and not the heavy oil potentially passing through it in the
proposed Keystone XL

pipeline, is what puts the bread in

America's breadbasket. "The water under the ground is the lifeblood
of this place," Gotschall says. "And there's nothing but sand between
the pipeline and the aquifer."

**Enbridge, a Canadian company responsible for 8,500 miles of
pipelines crisscrossing the U.S. and Canada, reportedly spilled close
to 1.3 million gallons of heavy crude in 400 separate spills between
2003-2008. The number and volume of these spills could potentially
be higher, given that no independent verification exists.**

Gotschall is a fourth-generation

Nebraska rancher, and his dad runs the family's certified organic
dairy operation that raises grass-fed cows just a couple miles from
where the pipeline is slated to go. "Which, in my opinion," says
the 29-year-old, "is close enough." He and many ranchers and farmers
across the heartland are deeply concerned about the proposed

Keystone XL pipeline, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill
in the Gulf exposed lax oversight, arguments over accountability,
and an unsettling relationship between the industry and its regulators.

At meetings convened by the U.S.

State Department in nearby Nebraska towns, Gotschall has not left
reassured.

Pipeline representatives repeatedly claimed the chance of a spill
is small,

and the amount of oil that could leak would be tiny. Gotschall is
skeptical.

"How long will it take for them to detect a leak?" he wonders, much
less stop it before the oil leaches into the sand---and directly into
the aquifer. He's heard officials say that the maximum leak would be
limited to a few barrels,

which Gotschall says is laughable. If the pipeline is flowing at
its projected capacity of 900,000 barrels per day, he calculates,
that would mean they would have to detect, locate, and fix the leak
in less than a second. "We all know it's not *if* a leak happens,
it's *when*," says

Gotschall. "I just don't buy their safety assurances."

He has good reason to be skeptical.

Despite promises that spills will be rare and small, the industry's
record speaks for itself. As an editorial in the

*Nebraska Journal Star* pointed out, "A

2006 rupture dumped 270,000 gallons on Alaska's North Slope. About
50,000

gallons oozed from a cracked pipeline in Wisconsin in 2007. About
210,000

gallons of crude spewed from a pipeline in central Minnesota last
year." Add to that a series of other spills and leaks this year alone,
including 126,000

gallons of crude that leaked in North

Dakota's Pembina County in January.

According to a report by the Natural

Resources Defense Council, Enbridge

"has been responsible for spilling more than four million gallons of
hazardous liquids (primarily crude oil); between

2003 and 2008, Enbridge pipeline accidents were responsible for 13

fatalities, 29 injuries and $633 million in property damage."22

Gotschall worries that the environmental assessments done so far also
gloss over the fact that Nebraska experiences significant seismic
activity in several parts of the state where the pipeline may be
installed. In 2002, a 4.3

magnitude earthquake shook the state,

and as recently as 2009 a 3.7

magnitude tremor hit, according to the

United States Geological Survey.23 "We have earthquakes here,"
Gotschall says.

"They don't have an earthquake mitigation plan."

Whether from spills, sabotage or earthquakes, Gotschall says the
impacts of Canadian tar sands heavy crude oil leaking into the sandy
soils of the region are too gruesome to imagine. He understands that
the country needs energy, but believes there are many better ways to
produce it. Nebraska has the third best wind potential of any state
in the country,

and he believes that agriculture can wean itself of much of its
dependence on fossil fuels by changing its practices to include more
grass-fed dairy like his family does. That would free up vast acreage
for cropland to be used for biofuels production instead of growing
corn for cattle.

Gotschall is especially frustrated with arguments that importing
tar sands from our northern neighbors is a great idea because Canada
is a "friendly nation." That doesn't exactly ring true to him these
days. "Putting an oil pipeline that may leak into my drinking water
doesn't sound like a friendly nation to me," he says. "That's akin
to an act of war in my book."

Just below the confluence of the Milk

River and the Missouri River in northeastern Montana, Don Brown tends
cows and wheat crops on the ranch where his grandfather homesteaded
when he came to the

New World from Ireland. The 12,000

acres he owns and leases provide habitat for some of the biggest mule
deer found in those parts, as well pronghorn herds migrating in the
fall and a way station for various migrating birds, including Sandhill

Cranes on their way back and forth from Canada. He's been treated to
the sight of 50 pair of sharp-tailed grouse dancing on his property,
which he hopes will someday be stewarded by his grandson who is about
to graduate high school---the fifth-generation

What Brown had never counted on was a pipeline slicing through his
property. If current plans go through,

the Keystone XL pipeline will bisect several of his pastures, a
plan that

Brown says he doesn't entirely oppose if he can just get some
assurances that don't seem to be forthcoming.

Brown, a soft-spoken 74-year-old who calls himself a "hay-shaker,"
says he has a slew of unanswered questions about how this pipeline
will affect his operations---and those of fellow ranchers and farmers
along the heartland corridor.

For starters, he wonders how the

TransCanada company that is behind the oil pipeline will safely lay
pipe in the sandy, unstable soils around the

Missouri River and near the famous

Missouri Breaks. "It's hard to even dig a post hole that'll stay
straight,"

Brown says.

Safety "is a big factor" for Brown and many ranchers in Montana who
have worked with the Northern Plains

Resource Council to organize into the

Northern Plains Pipeline Landowners

Group (NPPLG). The landowners are especially worried that the company
has applied for variances that will allow them to use thinner pipe
and lower safety standards than if it were running through an urban
area. The

NPPLG is concerned about liability issues, about compensation for
loss of land or property values, and about whether promises of new
local jobs and increased tax revenue will materialize. In particular,
they object to the application by TransCanada to the U.S. Department
of Transportation that calls for their area to be considered "low
consequence" for an

Bitumen Across the Big Missouri: A Montana Rancher's Perspective

*Nothing about the recent disaster in the Gulf has reassured rancher
Don Brown that the energy companies will step up or the government
will clean up a spill quickly.*

could be severely impacted by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.**

oil spill, and therefore eligible for safety exemptions.

Brown notes that he's worked on pipelines, as well as in copper
processing plants in Butte, and says he and his group just want a
fair deal that will protect their land and their families. "There is
so much coming at us," he says, right as most ranchers in the area
are more concerned with their branding operations than with reading
through thousands of pages of appendices and report language.

"Hay-shakers don't have the time or expertise to digest all that,"
he says.

They have digested the fact that the pipeline owners appear to be
asking a lot of landowners along the pipeline corridor, without
much compensation.

It's not clear to Brown and others, for example, who is liable for
leaks on private property, nor whether landowners will be compensated
for lost production or reduced property values. According to a study
for the real estate industry by Robert Simons,

pipeline leaks have a sharp effect on real estate values. "Some
leaks may be abrupt, while others may go undetected for a long period
of time,"

he writes. "Once contamination has been detected, property values of
affected residences can decrease

Brown says that nobody has made it clear to him who might be
responsible for a spill, and nothing about the recent disaster in
the Gulf has reassured him that the energy companies will step up or
the government will clean up quickly. Even without a leak, his land
broker told him that a pipeline easement on his ranch could cut the
land value by 30 percent.

"I don't need that," Brown says.

Brown worries that he and his fellow landowners along thousands of
miles of pipelines are going to be left with

"torn up roads and land, and end up with an easement all the way to

Texas." At community meetings around the state, landowners,

ranchers and farmers who would not normally ally themselves with
conservation causes are asking that their concerns be addressed. "If
they're going to force this on us,"

Brown says, "we want the very best we can get."

**ENDANGERING THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE**

**In 2010, Greater Sage-Grouse became a**

**"candidate" for being added to the**

**federal Endangered Species list due to**

**their widespread declines across the**

**prairie and sagebrush habitats of eleven**

**western states. This species is uniquely**

**sensitive to habitat disturbance, which**

**will occur through the construction and**

**operation of Keystone XL, particularly**

**near traditional breeding grounds known**

**as "leks." For example, sage-grouse**

**populations decline in conventional oil**

**and gas fields wherever more than one**

**EXPANDING THE WEB: PIPELINES BY BIG OIL FOR BIG OIL**

**The energy industry that is betting on Canadian tar sands has been
pushing for an**

**ever-expanding system of pipelines to guarantee that the U.S. will
become hooked on**

**bitumen for years to come. Two companies, Enbridge and TransCanada,
have built two**

**major pipeline systems, the Alberta Clipper and the first stage of
the Keystone**

**project, but continue to lobby for even more pipeline capacity.**

**Two of these proposed pipelines would run through Canada to ports
on either coast.**

**One, which would run from Alberta to Maine through Quebec, has run
into a buzz saw**

**of opposition from the Quebec government. Another, which would run
to Canada's**

**west coast through the province of British Columbia, has met
enormous opposition**

**from First Nations' communities**

**along its proposed route.**

**That leaves the Keystone XL pipeline,**

**which would link Alberta tar sands to**

**Gulf Coast refineries and ports.**

**Questions have been raised about**

**where the tar sands oil would go once**

**it is transported to the Gulf Coast**

**and refined. The oil then would be**

**ready for entry into the international**

**commodities markets, from China to**

**the European Union. Why, people**

**have asked, should the U.S. suffer the**

**environmental risks of a pipeline**

**through our heartland in order to**

**allow multinational energy companies**

**to make enormous profits selling**

**petroleum products to Asia or**

**Europe?**

**Much of the rhetoric surrounding the Canadian tar sands industry
has focused on the**

**idea of "energy security." But "security" comes in many forms,
and the National**

**Academy of Science recently released a report that underscores
the complex**

**relationship between energy consumption, production, and national
security. In the**

**report, titled "Limiting the Magnitude of Climate Change," the
authors state that**

**"Some actions taken to enhance energy security can actually
exacerbate climate**

**change. For example, if Canadian oil sands, or coal-based syn-fuels
were to substitute**

**for imported petroleum, GHG emissions could rise because of the
energy-intensive**

**production processes involved."24**

**In short, it seems unlikely that these tar sands pipelines are a
major boost to**

**America's energy security, as some of its supporters have argued. In
fact, increasing**

**numbers of policymakers, scientists, and Pentagon planners have
stated that climate**

**change is likely to be a bigger threat to national security than
making a transition to**

**renewable fuels. Meanwhile, the oil industry continues to lobby
incessantly to kill**

**policies that could save oil, including proposed climate and energy
legislation**

**currently pending in the U.S. Congress, and low-carbon fuel standards
like those that**

**have been enacted in California and Oregon.**

**The petroleum industry is proposing thousands and thousands of
additional miles of pipelines across the United States and Canada
creating an enormous web of pollution and destruction.25**

**A WARMING PLANET**

James Hansen is arguably the most well-respected and prescient climate
scientist in the world. Working for

NASA, he was one of the first government scientists to publicly warn
of the effects of climate change. In the late 1980s, he predicted
many of the impacts of a warming world that researchers around the
world have now measured and documented: the warmest global average
temperatures on record have occurred in the past

20 years; the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest
on record;

even April 2010 was the warmest April on record. Glaciers and ice
caps have been receding and melting, shifts in the climate have forced
animals to migrate earlier and plants to flower sooner, and sea level
is rising. Since

Hansen first warned Congress about climate change in 1988, the global
scientific community has gathered enough evidence to state that it is

"unequivocal" that the planet is warming and its climate is being
altered, and humans are contributing to these observed changes in
part through the burning of fossil fuels.

So when Hansen recently wrote in the British paper *The Guardian* that

"the tar sands of Canada constitute one of our planet's greatest
threats,"

it is worth taking notice.

**A DOUBLE-BARRELED THREAT**

Hansen points out that tar sands are a

"double-barreled threat" to our planet's climate systems. The first
problem is that burning carbon-based fuels emits carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere. Because of the nature of this greenhouse gas, it traps
the sun's heat as it is reflected from the earth's surface, and in
turn warms the planet below. Burning gasoline made from conventional
oil has long been seen as a major culprit in this process, but as

Hansen points out, "producing oil from tar sands emits two-to-three
times the global warming pollution of conventional oil."

That's just one part of the problem.

Canada's boreal forest serves as a living net to capture and store
carbon dioxide, through the absorption of CO2

by trees. Hansen calls this "one of the best carbon-reduction tools
on the planet." When the boreal forest is cut down for tar sands
development, two things happen: One, we lose the stored carbon in
the forests and wetlands.

Second, we lose the forest's ability to absorb new CO2.

**FROM BAD TO WORSE**

Future tar sands production is likely to make a bad situation
worse. Much of the remaining tar sands extraction will likely be done
through *in situ*

methods. Since this method requires companies to heat the subsurface
with steam, it is even more energy-

intensive---and therefore emits more greenhouse gases---than mined tar

What's even more troubling is that tar sands represent a move towards
poorer quality fuels. By opening a market for high carbon liquid
fuels, we are capitulating to intransigent energy companies who are
also planning on bringing oil shale, American tar sands in Utah,
and coal-to-liquids fuels to the

The cumulative effects of increasing tar sands production, Hansen
and other experts warn, essentially dooms us to a planet with a
heavier blanket of carbon dioxide cloaking our atmosphere. As carbon
dioxide levels increase, so will the planet's transformation into a
less hospitable

Tar Sands' Carbon Footprint: the Climate Change Connection

"America is addicted to oil," President

Bush told the country nearly five years ago. "The best way to break
this addiction is through technology," he said. "Since 2001, we have
spent nearly

$10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable alternative
energy sources. And we are on the threshold of incredible advances."

While some of that research is indeed ongoing, our federal policies
continue to tilt towards oil, with massive subsidies, tax breaks,
military expenditures and industry support for exploration, production,
transportation and refining of petroleum products. By contrast,
"alternative energies" receive a pittance, even as their potential
grows and the costs of our oil addiction literally are leaking in
our Gulf Coast communities.

The first steps on the path to an energy future that uses substantially
less oil are in front of our eyes already.

U.S. consumption of oil has actually declined, and the recent
recession showed how possible it is to begin lowering our consumption
by simple conservation. Off-the-shelf technology around the world
can give us much more fuel-efficient vehicles, and a move to more
electric and natural-gas powered cars, buses and trucks is already
underway. Biofuels made from algae and other crops show great
promise. A recent National Wildlife

Federation report, "Growing a Green

Energy Future: A Primer and Vision for

Sustainable Biomass Energy" outlines a series of important energy
sources.

Investments in better public trans-

portation systems are a no-brainer to reduce our dependence on oil.

We need to speed up the production and research into alternatives
to oil,

rather than pursuing ever-lower quality crude oil. Canadian tar sands
represent the most commercially viable of all the

"unconventional fuels," which include oil shale, coal-to-liquids,
and even tar sands deposits in Utah. All of these are dirtier compared
to oil. Each of them relies on polluting, energy-intensive processes,
and none of them represent a leap forward towards developing a clean,
sustainable energy source of the future. If we can stop encouraging
tar sands by building more pipelines, we can finally get serious
about pursuing the innovations of the future.

President Barack Obama, taking up on his predecessor's comments,
also recognized that America has an oil problem. "What will we do
about our addiction to foreign oil?" he has asked.

"We need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions. We have to
make a serious nationwide

Just Say No to Bitumen: Pursuing Better Alternatives

**SANDHILL CRANE & THE PLATTE RIVER**

**The central Platte River valley, a green oasis in an**

**otherwise semi-arid region on the edge of Nebraska's**

**Sandhills, is a critical stopover for migratory water birds**

**that travel on the Central Flyway from the Gulf Coast to**

**Canada, including one of North America's largest cranes,**

**the Sandhill Crane.**

**One of the most beautiful natural phenomena in the U.S. is**

**the annual congregation of the sandhill cranes. For about a**

**month each March, over 500,000 sandhill cranes converge**

**on the Platte River to rest and eat before they finish their**

**migration to their northern breeding grounds. The cranes**

**forage along the riverbanks, eating aquatic plants, animals**

**and insects, and nearby corn fields, and then sleep on the**

**1. CANCEL CONSTRUCTION OF TAR SANDS PIPELINES**. Keystone XL and
others that are in the planning phase would deepen the U.S. addiction
to dirty fuels and keep us dependent for decades.

**2.DON'T GIVE DIRTY FUELS A PASS.** International agreements like
the climate treaty currently being negotiated should NOT

exempt tar sands from greenhouse gas reduction targets. In addition,

the U.S. should end tax breaks for refineries that take tar sands while
certainly resisting any new tax breaks or incentives for dirty fuels.

**3.PASS COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE AND ENERGY LEGISLATION IN THE U.S.**

Comprehensive energy and climate legislation has the one ingredient
that is absolutely essential for any energy bill: holding oil companies
and other corporations across the economy accountable for doing their
fair share to reduce pollution.

Less pollution means more clean energy and more clean energy jobs.

Less pollution means galvanizing the investment we need to deploy
clean energy and clean transportation alternatives.

**4.MAKE CARS MORE FUEL EFFICIENT.** We need to safeguard the recent
and historic agreement made under the Clean Air Act,

between automakers,

environmentalists, California and the federal government that greatly
improves vehicle fuel economy and cuts transportation greenhouse gas
emissions. The new standards will cut oil consumption by 1.8 billion
barrels---and all parties are looking to move quickly to extend that
program beyond 2016 and enhance oil savings further.

**5. TIME FOR ELECTRIC CARS.**We need to take vehicle electrification
seriously. Starting October 2010,

virtually every major automaker will start selling familiar vehicles
that fuel at the equivalent of about 75

cents a gallon by plugging into the electric outlet in the
garage. Today we depend on petroleum for 95

percent of trans-portation fuel. With action now, that debilitating
strategic dependence can be fundamentally undermined.

**6.INVEST IN RAIL AND MASS TRANSIT.** High speed rail, transit and
freight projects boost local and regional economic development and cut
oil use and pollution. These projects also improve our quality of life,
modernize our cities, and drive job growth in domestic manufacturing,
infrastructure construction and operation.

Recommendations: Getting off of Dirty Fuels and Ushering in A New
Energy Policy commitment to developing new sources of energy and we
need to do it right away. Right now."

After the Deepwater Horizon explosion, Obama stood in front of the
microphones in the Rose Garden and said, "We know that our dependence
on foreign oil endangers our security and our economy. And the disaster
in the gulf only underscores that even as we pursue domestic production
to reduce our reliance on imported oil, our long-

term security depends on the development of alternative sources of
fuel and new transportation technologies."

The Administration has a tremendous opportunity to leave a legacy of
innovation in the energy sector.

Whether we seize this momentous political and economic opening to move
this country far enough---or fast enough remains to be seen. Louisiana
shrimpers, Montana ranchers,

Nebraskan dairymen, coastal residents threatened by sea rise, consumers
and businesses stressed by volatile energy prices, and citizens from
coast to coast who understand the need for profound change are all
waiting for presidential leadership to combat the enormous power of
Big Oil to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.

The word "addiction" comes from a

Latin word meaning "a giving over,

surrender." Agreeing to import

Canadian tar sands for decades by building new pipelines is nothing
more than surrender to our oil addiction.

Promising new technologies can and should be pursued that increase
our independence, not from foreign oil or even North American oil,
but from oil

Approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and other tar sands delivery
systems is not the way to break our oil addiction.

As NASA scientist James Hansen wrote,

"Now is a critical moment in the history of our planet. The U.S. and
Canadian governments must agree that the unconventional fossil fuels,
tar sands and tar shale, will not be developed."
