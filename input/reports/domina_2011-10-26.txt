**Executive Summary**

1. TransCanada, a foreign company engaged in the business of oil
transportation by pipeline holds itself out as a leader in the
development and operation of North American energy infrastructure. The
company proposes a Keystone pipeline which, when built, will be a
1,833 mile long pipeline that transports crude oil from Hardisty,
Alberta, across Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, including a portion
of the Nebraska Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer, Kansas, Missouri, and
Oklahoma with a terminus at Cushing, Oklahoma. There the transported
oil will connect with another pipeline system and move to Port Arthur,
Texas, to be processed and sold on the international oil market.

2. The pipeline will pass through an area of Nebraska not now
punctuated by oil pipeline structures. The area to be crossed includes
the pristine Ogallala Aquifer and the fragile Nebraska Sandhills. A
map of the project borrowed from the US Department of State website1
appears below. The Ogallala Aquifer is depicted below, too.

3. Legal questions have arisen concerning Nebraska's role and authority
as a State government. This green paper analyzes legal concerns in
three areas:

3.1 Where oil pipelines are concerned, what can Nebraska regulate? 3.2
Does Nebraska have authority to regulate its land use by limiting
pipeline routes? 3.3 If Nebraska has the authority to act, how and
when must it do so?

4. After careful study, we conclude Nebraska can regulate its own
land use.

Federal safety regulations preempt *how* the pipeline must be built,
but Nebraska has the right to control, reasonably and responsibly,
*where* it must be built. Pipeline *safety* is federally preempted
but oil pipeline *siting* is not.

5. Nebraska's authority must be exercised by its Legislature. The
Legislature should act before commencement of State Department
authorization for a Canadian border crossing, or construction as
eminent domain proceedings which will likely follow in Nebraska.

6. Unlike the federal government's control of pipeline safety, the
United States lacks authority to regulate, prescribe, or proscribe
sites or routes for proposed pipelines, even

2 Source: http://web.mit.edu/

if they are interstate lines. This deficit concerning oil pipelines
contrasts with national authority over natural gas pipelines. Federal
control over such pipelines is found in the *Natural Gas Act*, 15
*USC* §§ 717 *et seq*. While certificates of public convenience
and necessity are required to operate gas pipelines, no similar
requirement mandates oil pipeline owners or operators must obtain
certification from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
or any other federal agency.

7. The federal government has not preempted the States enacting
pipeline siting issues within a State. Where the federal government
has not acted, the States may. Federal law preempts pipeline safety
issues so Nebraska has no significant role in pipeline design or
construction criteria which is wholly separate from route siting.

8. Though Nebraska has the power to regulate locations at which
pipelines will be placed, it has not exercised this power. Nebraska
is without a statute designing how a proposed route submitted for
approval is to be handled. Simply, Nebraska has no statute pertaining
to any permitting requirements that apply specifically to construction
or operation of oil pipelines.

9. Nebraska has the legal power to regulate its land use and thereby
control the routes for oil pipelines across the State. TransCanada
has one oil pipeline across Nebraska; its location was acquired
without controversy about three years ago. This pipeline lies in an
easement large enough to accommodate TransCanada's second pipeline
across the State. The Legislature can require TransCanada to use
its existing corridor again in eastern Nebraska by enacting a law
generally requiring pipeline companies to consolidate their pipelines
in reasonable corridors to maximize land utilization and minimize
interference with land use by others.

10. But, to exercise this power, the Legislature must enact a
statute and the Governor must approve it. This should occur and be
accomplished by the end of 2011. Presently, Nebraska has no pipeline
siting statute. It does have an eminent domain statute that permits
pipelines to exercise the power of eminent domain. *Neb Rev Stat*
§ 57-1101. If Nebraska's Legislature enacts a thoughtful statute
governing pipeline siting, it is likely the statute will be valid
and enforceable against TransCanada and all other oil pipeline
companies. At ¶¶ 86 *et seq*. possible courses of action are
collected and listed. The list is not exhaustive.

11. Nebraska's siting authority may be more theoretical than real if
it delays action. Once the United States State Department issues a
permit authorizing construction of the pipeline and the route across
Montana and South Dakota is finalized, it will be difficult to compel
TransCanada to move its proposed pipeline eastward to its existing
corridor. October 26, 2011 David A Domina

**Analysis**

**I. What Is Nebraska's Regulatory Interest Over Oil Pipelines?**

12. Oil pipelines consume land, interfere with its use, limit
alternatives for its economic development and create barriers
for owners and the public. They must be accepted when planning,
accommodated when building, and avoided when digging. As structures
pipelines can force rerouting, or halt development of water and
sewer mains, electrical and telecommunications lines, and constrain
economic growth. Accordingly, pipelines must be dealt with in
land use terms. They cannot be permitted to be placed willy-nilly
everywhere. Oil pipeline placement is, therefore, a matter of
undeniable State interest.3

13. In recent publications by TransCanada and its lawyers, arguments
have been made suggesting that Nebraska's regulatory authority over
pipelines has been preempted by the federal government. But, this is
not correct. Federal regulatory preemption governing oil pipelines
has occurred only in the area of pipeline design and construction
safety. Regulation of land use within States, i.e., defining the
route or site at which a pipeline can be constructed, has not been
preempted by federal law.

14. Indeed, State oil pipeline approval is required in numerous
areas of regulatory activity. This is readily displayed in the
permits, approvals, and regulatory requirements section of the US
Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Impact Study of the
proposed TransCanada Keystone pipeline.4 It names numerous State and
local governmental approvals, collaborations, and reviews necessarily
completed before oil pipeline construction can occur.

15. Certainly, federal authority is present in connection with
TransCanada's need for government approval for its proposed pipeline
project. The US President's Executive Order 1337 commits to the
Department of State oversight and review in

3 Zoning laws are the classic example, see *Hadacheck v. Sebastian*,
239 U.S. 394 (1915) (prohibition of brickyard operations);
*Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.*, 272 U.S. 365 (1926)
(prohibition of industrial use); *Gorieb v. Fox*, 274 U.S. 603, 608
(1927) (requirement that portions of parcels be left unbuilt); *Welch
v. Swasey*, 214 U.S. 91 (1909) (height restriction), which have been
viewed as permissible governmental action even when prohibiting the
most beneficial use of the property.

connection with applications for Presidential Permits for pipeline
border crossings. A series of additional executive orders ensure
compliance in other areas.5

16. The TransCanada Keystone pipeline, as proposed, illustrates the
massive, long term impact of a pipeline on land use in the State. In
Nebraska, the TransCanada Keystone pipeline proposes to encompass
these land requirements:

16.1 A 110-foot wide construction right of right-of-way easement
across the width of the State consisting of a:

16.1.1 60-foot temporary workspace easement generally across the
State; and

16.1.2 50-foot permanent easement for construction and service.

17. Greater than 3,400 acres of Nebraska land will be affected
directly during construction, and 1,560 acres of Nebraska land will
be effectively taken on a permanent basis. Millions of cubic yards
of borrow material are expected to be required for temporary storage
during construction, and to stabilize land and permanent facilities
and to pad pipelines. Seven contractor yards, from Holt County in the
north to Gage County in the south of Nebraska, are expected to be used,
covering a combined 191 acres. Three railroad siding facilities in
Merrick, York, and Jefferson Counties, utilizing 60 acres, will be
committed to the project. Nine pump storage sites in eight Nebraska
counties will use 274 combined acres. Four of those counties, Keya
Paha, Holt, Wheeler, and Greeley, include stretches of the Nebraska
Sandhills. At least six of them, Keya Paha, Holt, Wheeler, Greeley,
Nance, and Hamilton also include reaches of the Ogallala Aquifer.

18. The EPA's Environmental Impact Statement discloses the pipeline
will cross under or through these Nebraska rivers6:

19. The EPA's EIS also identifies the fact that 160 additional water
body crossings are expected to occur in Nebraska. Both rainwater
basin wetlands and

Sandhills wetlands would be crossed within the State. As planned, the
project proposes open cut crossings, including streambed disturbances.7

20. At least three endangered species of wildlife within the State will
be affected. So will endangered aquatic, plant, and insect species.8

21. As proposed, the TransCanada pipeline will cross 254.1 miles of
privately- owned Nebraska land, and includes 15% of the length of the
project. 115.3 miles of this land is used for crop production. 124.7
miles is used as range land. The remainder is developed, open water,
wetland, or wooded land.9 Its permanent right of way, and construction
furrow will look like this10:

22. The pipeline, as proposed, will pass within two miles of seven
Nebraska communities, ranging from Ericson in Wheeler County to Steele
City in Jefferson County.11 Under Nebraska law, TransCanada may be
required to comply with municipal regulations.12 The pipeline will
constitute a 36" diameter13 barrier to be dealt with on hundreds of
east-west roads, dozens of railroads, and bridges, and will impact

infrastructure development and repair in the State, driving up costs
for Nebraska and its political subdivisions for the foreseeable
future. Nebraska does not permit private road construction, or other
common carrier infrastructure to be built without State attention to
land use interests. Even a single storage tank for oil is regulated.14
The smallest phone company, serving the smallest village, must obtain
State permission for most actions, and certainly to operate.15 Yet,
under current State law, oil pipeline siting is not regulated.

23. TransCanada has a pipeline through the State now. It was acquired
recently with no controversy. Alternate routes for the Keystone
pipeline have been discussed. Some are exemplified in Appendix 1.16
But this Green Paper's purpose is not to focus on a single pipeline
or route. It is to study and provide information concerning the legal
authority Nebraska possesses and the alternatives available to the
State to control use of its land and resources. After consideration,
the conclusion emerges that State authority to regulate exists in
federal and state law. But it can also be found within the brief
history of the TransCanada Keystone pipeline. To this extent, the
Keystone pipeline provides some useful information that informs one
to the answer of the legal question under scrutiny.

24. The EPA found that TransCanada must comply with State air quality
and noise restrictions, noting that Montana's requirements are more
stringent than those imposed by federal law.17 This point does not
appear to be contested by TransCanada. This is an overt concession to
the power of State governments to regulate the pipeline in areas not
preempted by federal law. The concession is well placed since federal
preemption of siting has not occurred. **Areas of Federal Regulation**

25. The United States, as a federal government, embarked on preemptive
regulation in the area of pipeline safety in 1992, by enacting the
*Pipeline Safety Act*, 49 *USC* §§ 60101 *et seq.18*

26. Pipeline safety is preempted by federal law, and regulations
issued under the Act are given effect to assure pipeline design and
construction safety.19 Even drug testing regulations for workers have
been upheld under the Act.20 The regulations under

14 267 *Neb Admin Code* § 3-024, and other rules of the Nebraska
Oil & Gas Conservation Comm'n. 15 291 *Neb Admin Code* § 5-001. 16

is taken from EPA Environment Impact Statement, ES 13 Aug 26, 2011. 17
EPA Environment Impact Statement, § 3.12, Aug 26, 2011. 18 This Act
combined and recodified two previous safety statutes, the *Hazardous
Liquid Pipeline Safety Act* of 1979

and *the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act* of 1968. 19 *Skinner* *v. Mid
America Pipeline Co*, 490 US 212 (1989) 20 *International Broth of
Elec Workers Local 1245 v. Skinner*, 912 F2d 1454 (9th Cir 1990).

the Act depend on a definition of "pipeline." The term is defined
by federal regulations as but not by Nebraska law. Under federal
regulations:

Pipeline or pipeline system means all parts of a pipeline facility
through which a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide moves in
transportation, including, but not limited to, the pipe, valves,
and other appurtenances connected to line pipe, pumping units,
fabricated assemblies associated with pumping units, metering, and
delivery stations, and fabricated assemblies therein, and break-out
tanks.... Pipeline facility means new and existing pipe, rights-of-way,
and any equipment, facility, or building used in the transportation
of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide.21

Crude oil pipelines and natural gas pipelines must both comply with
federal safety criteria. Natural gas pipelines, which transport a
hazardous ultimately usable product must comply with federal siting
criteria. There are no such federal siting criteria for crude oil
pipelines like the proposed TransCanada Keystone line.

27. A number of judicial decisions have dealt with what is preempted
by the *Pipeline Safety Act* and its regulations. Generally, States
are permitted to impose fees on pipeline operators to delay costs of
conducting inspections where required to be permitted by States.22
State law, governing land use and requiring a pipeline company
to deepen its lines to accommodate drainage improvements, was not
preempted.23 In the Eighth Circuit, control of pipeline crossings
under county roads does not appear to be wholly preempted.24

28. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has held
that State laws purporting to regulate the safety aspects of pipeline
design or construction are preempted by federal law.25 In *Kinley*,
the court cited the US Supreme Court's Supremacy Clause26 and noted
that federal law may supersede State law in multiple ways, but that
congressional intention to supersede, or refrain from doing so, is
critical to determining whether supersession occurs. The court noted
that the *Pipeline Safety Act* of 1992 amended numerous statutes and
imposed new duties on the US Secretary of Transportation.27

26 *US Const* *Art* VI CL 2. 27 49 *USC* § 2002(a), (b), confirming
the court's view that safety standards were preempted by the Act.

29. But *Kinley* does not address questions concerning State authority
to regulate land use. It is well settled that "the historic police
powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] federal act
unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress."28 One
must "look first to the language of a statute to determine Congress's
intent."29 Further, "[t]here is a presumption against preemption in
areas of traditional State regulation,"30 which "is overcome if it
was the 'clear and manifest purpose of [the agency]' to supersede
State authority."31

30. The States historically control land use issues. Land use and
zoning issues have " 'always been an intensely local area of the
law.' "32 More specifically, it has been established for quite
some time that zoning restrictions on the sizes and placement of
outdoor advertisements are well within the police power of States
and municipalities.33 In 2009, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held:

"Land use policy such as zoning customarily has been considered
a feature of local government and an area in which the tenets of
federalism are particularly strong." *Mount Olivet,* 164 F3d at
487. In such circumstances, we are particularly averse to find
preemption. *See Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry,* 555 F3d 1199, 1204
(10th Cir 2009) (holding that the presumption against preemption
"applies with greater force when the alleged conflict is in an area
traditionally occupied by the States").34

31. In the area of natural gas, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has been given "exclusive authority to approve or
deny an application for the siting... of natural gas pipelines and
terminals."35 But, there is no such statute governing the construction
of oil pipelines. No federal agency has been given regulatory control
over oil pipeline siting. The Eighth Circuit recognized this dilemma,
noting that natural gas pipelines are a scheme of federal laws
preempting the States,36 but also noting there is no such express
regulation affecting oil pipelines.37 28 *Cipollone v. Liggett Group,

32. In short, the federal government has regulated in the area of oil
pipeline safety, but not siting. The States are left with the right
to decide where, within their jurisdictions, pipelines can be sited so
long as they exercise the power in a manner that does not so obstruct
commerce as to interfere unreasonably with its conduct. **Federal
Constitutional Considerations**

33. The Supremacy Clause and Commerce Clause of the US Constitution are
two prominent federal constitutional considerations that impact State
regulation of oil pipelines. As noted above, the Supremacy Clause,
which serves as the foundation for the doctrine of federal preemption,
does not prevent Nebraska from regulating land use by requiring that
pipelines be located reasonably within the State so as to protect the
State's land use plan and prevent undue interference with others. There
is no federal statutory or regulatory scheme preempting Nebraska's
regulation of land use in connection with oil pipelines. Congress's
intention to leave this to the State is manifest in its decision to
give siting authority over gas pipelines to a federal agency.38 The
Congressional Research Office so informed Nebraska Congressman Lee
Terry in a September 20, 2010 Memorandum.39

34. The Commerce Clause prevents Nebraska from enacting laws
or regulations that unduly impede commerce between or among the
States. Nebraska cannot grant undue preferences to its own citizens
in matters affecting interstate commerce. It cannot engage in
favoritism. But, the State can regulate land use even- handedly so
its regulations apply, with equal force and clarity to Nebraskans
and non- Nebraskans, without running afoul of the dormant Commerce
Clause. Discussion appears below.

35. Some concern has been expressed that the Commerce Clause of the
US Constitution preempts action by Nebraska. The US Constitution
gives Congress the power "to regulate commerce with foreign nations,
and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes."40 This
"Commerce Clause" is sometimes said to have an implicit, or "dormant"
component that empowers the federal government to trump states when
federal interests outweigh those of the States, individually.41 State
regulations are not inherently, or even preferentially, preempted
by the dormant Commerce Clause: 38 Many authorities support this
statement. One interesting one is, Briefing *Paper #1: Regulatory
Aspects of CO2*

*Pipeline Infrastructure Development*, Colorado
Dept of Natural Resources, available at
http://dnr.state.co.us/SiteCollectionDocuments/CCS%20DOCS/CO2PipelineInfrastructure.pdf

39 The Memorandum, by Paul Parfomak, Specialist in Energy &
Infrastructure Policy, 7-0030 is entitled "Information on Federal
Law Related to Siting and Safety of Oil Pipelines. See, the paper at
http://boldnebraska.org/uploaded/pipeline/CongressionalResearchServicereport.pdf

40 *US Const* Art I, Sec 8, Cl 3. 41 The balancing of interest process
was overtly announced in *Pike v Bruce Church, Inc.,* 397 US 137
(1970).

"Where the [State] statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate
a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate
commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden
imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the
putative local benefits."42

Under the *Pike* standard, the burden is on the party challenging a
State law to prove it imposes a burden on interstate commerce that
is too great to bear.

36. The Commerce Clause must be considered in connection with
the federal Supremacy Clause43 providing for the superiority of
federal law in areas where the federal government legislates or
regulates. Preemption may be express or implied. As noted above,
there is no express federal preemption of oil pipeline siting. Implied
preemption can occur in two ways, i.e., a field can be preempted,
or conflicts between State and federal laws can have the effect
of preempting.44 Field preemption exists when Congress's intent
to supersede State law altogether is found in a scheme of federal
regulation "so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that
Congress left no room to supplement it."45 "Conflict preemption"
occurs when compliance "with both federal and State regulations is
a physical impossibility."46 Conflict preemption also occurs where
State law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."47

37. Nebraska has no known land use regulation that expressly
conflicts with the federal government. The federal government has
no law or regulation suggesting that oil pipelines can be built
willy-nilly across States in criss-cross fashion, or a few hundred
feet apart. There is nothing to suggest that States cannot require
reasonable corridors for pipeline construction to protect and preserve
populations, land structures and formations, wilderness areas,
or to otherwise preserve and regulate land quality and land use,
or to protect natural resources within a State.

38. Nothing expressed in any federal statute suggests that Congress
intended to leave no room for States to supplement the control of
pipelines by defining where they may be built. To the contrary,
there is authority that where regulations do not impermissibly
discriminate against interstate commerce, State and local taxes,
permit requirements, and construction location requirements will be
held valid. For example, a franchise fee of $59,000 per mile for an
oil pipeline across Santa Monica, California, was

valid.48 The dormant Commerce Clause was rejected in a case holding
that States can regulate the manner in which contracts involving
pipelines are negotiated.49

39. Public safety measures concerning construction or operation of a
pipeline are preempted by federal law.50 But, there is no indication
that land use requirements, if reasonable and not unduly restrictive
of commerce, will be enforced.

40. The Commerce Clause forbids only the promotion of local economic
interest over out-of-state interests. It does not forbid restrictions
that even-handedly apply to both interstate and intrastate companies.51
Nebraska is not precluded by the dormant Commerce Clause from
adopting a statute that would apply equally to State and local oil
pipeline companies, and to those from outside the State, or outside
the United States.

41. This is the analysis applied to determine whether the dormant
Commerce Clause requires that a State or local law be stricken as
unduly burdensome to interstate commerce:

To determine whether a law violates this so-called "dormant" aspect
of the Commerce Clause, we first ask whether it discriminates on

interstate commerce, does not constitute "simply economic
protectionism." Indeed, if the statute simply requires that all
pipeline companies, or all pipeline companies with actual or proposed
pipelines similarly situated, must act similarly as they seek a route
through the State, is not discriminatory but advances legitimate
State purposes. Nebraska has an interest in controlling the number of
interstate structures carrying hazardous liquids across the State.53
It has an interest in confining the geographic location of those
structures to maximize land use, as well as other efficiencies. And,
it has an interest in protecting the land.54 These interests can be
advanced by adopting legislation that takes one of several forms,
including these two forms generally:

42.1 The legislation can define a set of circumstances applying to all
pipelines whose circumstances fall within the definitions. For example,
if a pipeline company has an existing oil pipeline route through the
State and desires to build a second and if the pipeline can be built
within the location of the original pipeline's easement, or adjacent
to it, without undue or unreasonable restraint on interstate commerce,
then the State can require that the company place its pipelines in
the same easement area.

42.2 Second, the State could require pipeline companies apply for
corridor permits to build their presently-proposed and future pipelines
across the State, and existing pipelines will be grandfathered in,
provided their routes shall constitute the corridor for their owners,
or the affiliates of their owners and their owners' successors,
across Nebraska. This approach, too, would assure that legitimate
State interests in land utilization and preservation are advanced
by consolidating geographic areas where pipelines pass, and thereby
limiting the impositions on land use and infrastructure that can come
from the lack of foresight, coordination, and creation of utility
corridors for oil pipelines.

43. In TransCanada's case, the company has an existing pipeline route
extending from near Yankton, South Dakota, southward to Steele City,
Nebraska. It now proposes a pipeline entering the State approximately
100 miles west of Yankton, and angling vertically across the Ogallala
Aquifer, and a stretch of the Sandhills, southward eventually to
Steele City but forming a triangle in the northern two-thirds of
the State. This triangulated line can be eliminated by a statute
requiring consolidation of pipelines into a corridor, or utilization
of an existing pipeline easement for a second line to be owned by
the company already transacting oil pipeline business within the State.

the Evolution of Energy Policy in New Mexico,* 17 Nat Res
J 283 (1977) for a discussion of state interests. 54 See

**II. Is Nebraska's Legal Authority To Regulate Land Use Preempted?**

44. Nebraska's legal authority to regulate land use with respect to oil
pipelines crossing the State has not been preempted by federal law. The
State's authority to require that oil pipelines be placed in approved
sites, or sites that meet reasonable Legislature criteria, is intact.

45. In fact, Nebraska's law clearly does regulate certain
pipelines. Its laws will control the process of acquiring land for the
pipeline from Nebraskans, and the State's law, including its eminent
domain law, is a sovereign power held exclusively by the State. The
State can regulate oil pipeline siting by constricting the use of the
power of eminent domain to circumstances in which legislative criteria,
reasonably established, are satisfied.

46. Nebraska has a well established eminent domain procedure and a
history of legislative protection, and extension, of the sovereign
authority to delegees. Delegation has occurred to departments of State
government, local government, and utilities.55 It has consciously
delegated or withheld the power of eminent domain as a matter of
legislative prerogative.

The legislature has the plenary power not only to grant or withhold
the right to exercise the power of eminent domain, but also to define
the quantum of interest or estate which may be acquired, whether an
easement or the fee or some estate intermediate these two, such as
a base, conditional, or determinable fee.56

47. The Nebraska Legislature's oil pipeline legislative authority is
substantial; the Body is not obligated to delegate sovereign powers,
including eminent domain, to a private company. **State Pipeline
Regulations**

48. Nebraska has adopted, administratively sections of the federal
regulations57 enacted pursuant *Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act*.58
Nebraska does not appear to have adopted any federal regulations
related, in any way, to oil pipeline safety. There are no federal
oil pipeline siting regulations. The State's pipeline regulations
are negligible.

*Neb Rev Stat* § 3-144; Roads, *Neb Rev Stat* § 39-1320; Cities,

regulations adopted by incorporation into state law are at 49 CFR
Pts 191, 192, 193 & 199. 58 49 USC § 6101 *et seq.*

**Control of Eminent Domain**

49. No one doubts that Nebraska law controls the eminent domain process
applicable to right-of-way condemnation by utilities, and pipelines.

50. Eminent domain authority emanates from one federal and one State
constitutional source. First the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution
provides, among its guaranteed rights:

No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation.59

51. The Nebraska Constitution's eminent domain clause is notably
broader than the federal provision:

The property of no person shall be taken or damaged for public use
without just compensation therefor.60

52. Eminent domain was explained in 2010 by the Nebraska Court of
Appeals as follows:

We first summarize the nature of eminent domain. Eminent domain is
defined generally as the power of the nation or a State, or authorized
public agency, to take or to authorize the taking of private property
for a public use without the owner's consent, conditioned upon the
payment of just compensation. *Krambeck v. City of Gretna,* 198 Neb
608, 254 NW2d 691 (1977). The power of eminent domain is a sovereign
power which exists independent of the Constitution of Nebraska. *Burger
v. City of Beatrice,* 181 Neb 213, 147 NW2d 784 (1967). The Legislature
may delegate the power of eminent domain. See *Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Chaulk,* 262 Neb 235, 631 NW2d 131 (2001). The
Constitution of Nebraska and legislative enactments pursuant thereto
are in no sense a grant of power, but are and should be treated as
a limitation of the power of eminent domain.61

The important teaching of these holdings is that the Legislature
has broad authority to grant or withhold delegation of the power
of condemnation.

59 *US Const* Amend V, Cl 5. 60 *Neb Const* Art I, § 21. *61* *City of
Omaha v. Tract No. 1*, 18 Neb App 247, 251, 778 NW2d 122, 127 (2010).

53. State Legislatures have some, but not absolute, authority to
delegate legal power to private companies. This includes the power to
delegate the sovereign power of eminent domain. One common instance of
delegation involves common carriers. A common carrier is a business
that transports people or services to the general public under a
license or authority provided by a regulatory body.62 The common
carrier approach means that the private service provider is subject
to special duties to ensure fair terms of access and reasonable
rates. Whether a pipeline is a common carrier of a State may depend
on State law and case law.

54. The common carrier approach originated with the railroads -- a
common carrier which transports people and goods, instead of oil via
pipeline. As in the railroad industry, monopoly power was a concern
in the oil industry at the turn of the 19th century, but the concern
was dissipated with the breakup of the Standard Oil Trust in 1911.63
In fact, antitrust policy developed largely as the result of mergers,
pricing, and access behavior during the early oil pipeline development
period.64 As a result of abuses by the Standard Oil company, Congress
enacted the 1906 Hepburn Amendment to the *Interstate Commerce Act*,
which gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) (which later
became the Surface Transportation Board (STB)) federal regulatory
responsibility over interstate oil pipelines. Under the Act, most
interstate oil pipelines were granted common carrier status, shipment
rates were required to be "just and reasonable," and shipments were
required to be allocated on a nondiscriminatory basis.65

55. Under a common carrier approach, anyone who wishes to transport
oil through a pipeline may do so on payment of the appropriate fee.66
Common carriage systems fall into two categories: voluntary and
compulsory. Under a voluntary common carriage, a pipeline company
is free to elect to provide a common carriage service or not.67
If it provides transportation services to any customer, it must
stand ready to provide transportation services to all customers at
nondiscriminatory rates.68 Under compulsory

common carriage, a pipeline has no option; it must provide
transportation services to anyone who wants them. 69

56. State Legislatures may, but are not required to, delegate the
power of eminent domain. The Nebraska Supreme Court explained the
process in a comprehensive 1946 decision:

Eminent domain is the power to take private property for public use. 1
Bouv.Law Dict., 588. It is the power which remains in the government
to resume the possession of property upon making just compensation
therefor, whenever the public interest requires it. This right of
resumption may be exercised, when required for the public good,
in the construction of a railroad, public road, canal, or other
like work. The right of eminent domain, however, does not permit the
sovereign power to take the property of one citizen, and transfer it
to another even for full compensation. Beekman v. Saratoga, etc.,
R. Co., 3 Paige, N.Y., [45], 73, [22 Am.Dec. 679]. In other words,
the right of eminent domain gives to the legislature the control of
private property for public uses, and for public uses only. 2 Kent,
Comm., 339, and cases cited. This being the rule, the property must be
used for the purpose which justified its taking, otherwise it would be
a fraud on the owner and an abuse of power, and the authority being in
derogation of private right, is to be strictly construed.' The right to
exercise the power of eminent domain rests in the Legislature. This is
stated in McInnis v. Brown County Water Improvement District No. 1,
Tex.Civ.App., 41 S.W.2d 741, 744, as follows: 'Eminent domain, or
the power to take private property for public use, is an inherent and
inalienable attribute of sovereignty. Its delegation to the Legislature
is implied from the general grant of legislative power; requires
no express authority; and constitutional provisions touching it are
generally regarded as limitations upon the legislative authority. See
20 C.J. p. 513, § 1; 10 R.C.L., p. 11, § 9; Lewis on Eminent Domain
(3d Ed.) vol. 1, pp. 20, 21, §§ 9 and 10.'

The Legislature has the right to delegate this power and to restrict or
limit the extent of its use. As stated in 18 Am.Jur., Eminent Domain,
§ 114, p. 740: 'The legislature has the plenary power not only to
grant or withhold the right to exercise the power of eminent domain,
but also to define the quantum of interest or estate which may be
acquired, whether an easement or the fee or some estate intermediate
these two, such as a base, conditional, or determinable fee. The
interest taken depends always on the construction of the statute
authorizing the taking. Generally, the rule of construction applied
to determine the extent of the grant of the power of

69 *Id.*

eminent domain is that its exercise is limited to the express
terms or clear implication of the statute in which the grant is
contained. So, if a statute expressly or by necessary implication
declares that a fee shall be taken, the condemner will acquire the
fee specified. Whether the granting of such an estate is good public
policy, there being no constitutional restriction, is a legislative,
not a judicial, question. But where the language of the statute will
bear that construction, courts, as a general rule, seem disposed to
leave the fee in the landowner.70

57. The Nebraska Legislature has made delegations of the power of
eminent domain; it includes pipeline companies. One Nebraska statute
mentions pipeline companies as delegees of Legislative authority to
exercise the power of eminent domain in Nebraska. It provides:

Any person engaged in, and any company, corporation, or association
formed or created for the purpose of transporting or conveying crude
oil, petroleum, gases, or other products thereof in interstate commerce
through, or across the State of Nebraska, or intrastate within the
State of Nebraska, and desiring or requiring a right-of-way or other
interest in real estate, and being unable to agree with the owner
or lessee of any land, lot, right-of-way or other property for the
amount of compensation for the use and occupancy of so much of any lot,
land, real estate, right-of-way or other property as may be reasonably
necessary for the laying, relaying, operation and maintenance of any
such pipeline or the location of any plant or equipment necessary to
operate such pipeline, shall have the right to acquire the same for
such purpose through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. The
procedure to condemn property shall be exercised in the manner set
forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.71

58. Delegees of the power of eminent domain must abide by the rules
laid down by the Legislature:

The power of eminent domain may be delegated by the Legislature. *Van
Patten v. City of Omaha,* 167 Neb 741, 94 NW2d 664 (1959). Although
railroads are private corporations, they have been given the statutory
authority to acquire land through eminent domain. See NebRevStat §
74- 308 (Reissue 1996). See, also, *Gustin v. Scheele,* 250 Neb 269,
549 NW2d 135 (1996). We have stated that "[p]roceedings to subject
the property of another for public use under the doctrine of eminent
domain must be conducted in the manner prescribed by the statute
delegating the power." *Spencer v. Village of Wallace,* 153 Neb 536,
544, 45 NW2d 473, 477

70 *Burnett v. Cent. Neb Pub. Power & Irr. Dist.*, 147 Neb 458,
465-66, 23 NW2d 661, 666-67 (1946). 71 *Neb Rev Stat* § 57-1101.

(1951). See, *SID No. 1 v. Nebraska Pub. Power Dist., supra; Engelhaupt
v. Village of Butte,* 248 Neb 827, 539 NW2d 430 (1995). Pursuant to §
74- 308, railroads are required to exercise their eminent domain power
in accordance with Nebraska's general eminent domain statutes. See
§ 76- 701 et seq.72

59. Nebraska's Constitution, statutes, regulations, and ultimately
its courts have clear, present, and well defined roles in the legal
processes involved in the movement of a pipeline through the State
by an interstate carrier. The eminent domain process is one of the
areas in which State law controls over federal rules.

60. The power of eminent domain could be withdrawn from pipelines,
or oil pipelines, by the Legislature. Instead of the current grant of
this power, the Legislature could reasonably constrain the eminent
domain authority to oil pipelines so it could be used only where
takings are to occur in locations, and on terms, consistent with the
State's reasonable siting criteria.

61. For example, the Legislature could find that the Ogallala's
Aquifer's value to the State and nation are transcendent, and that
water which, as the Nebraska Constitution recognizes, is a natural
want,73 requires oil pipelines be placed in locations where they do
not intersect the Aquifer, or where the intersection over the Aquifer
is controlled.

62. Similarly, the power of eminent domain could be constrained
to limit the geography in which oil pipelines built for interstate
transmission, or primarily interstate transmission of oil, may be
located. Existing corridors could be required to be used unless the
pipeline company can demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence,
that it cannot use the existing pipeline for reasons associated with
a need for compliance with the federal oil pipeline safety laws.

63. The Legislature could withhold the power of eminent domain from an
oil pipeline company seeking a route solely because its proposed site
for an interstate oil transmission line is economically beneficial to
the company, or it would simply be cheaper to route the line across
a convenient route, rather than build it across one consistent with
Nebraska's land use policy.

64. These general approaches to effectively constraining the use
of eminent domain, or otherwise regulating oil pipeline siting, are
consistent with the State's manifest interest in regulating its land
use and do not burden interstate commerce. They permit an interstate
oil pipeline company to build a pipeline, indeed several, across 72
*Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Chaulk*, 262 Neb 235, 241-42,
631 NW2d 131, 137 (2001). 73 *Neb Const Art* XV § 4; *Neb Rev Stat*
§ 46-201.

Nebraska, but they prevent the pipeline from crossing the State
in multiple locations at diverse points, instead of reasonably
consolidating pipeline construction into a localized corridor.

**Nebraska's Control of Pipeline *Siting* is Not Inconsistent With
Federal Control of Pipeline *Safety***

65. State regulation of oil pipeline siting within Nebraska can be
achieved on terms entirely consistent with federal regulation of oil
pipeline safety. Safety criteria promulgated by the federal government
include specifications for pipe steel, strength, structure integrity,
valve quality, couplers and coupler quality, and joint supports,
among many other things. These criteria apply regardless of the
pipeline's site. The flanges necessary to connect two pipes and be
compliant with federal law are the same whether the pipeline enters
Nebraska in Keya Paha County or Cedar County. There is no federal
distinction in the safety regulations based on where within Nebraska,
or any other State, an oil pipeline is located.

66. Nebraska can, therefore, regulate oil pipeline siting without
interfering, or legislating on terms inconsistent with, federal
pipeline safety standards. This point can be readily understood
by inspecting a recent federal Order compelling TransCanada to
take corrective action to prevent and halt oil spills from its
existing interstate pipeline across Nebraska. The US Department of
Transportation Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
("PHMSA"), the federal agency responsible for pipeline safety,
monitoring, and regulatory enforcement, dealt with TransCanada
recently.

67. TransCanada experienced a series of spills or leaks from its
existing pipeline across Nebraska, principally outside of the State
prior to June 2011. As a result, mandatory information submissions
were made to PHMSA. It issued a corrective Order as a result. PHMSA
found, in its Order issued against TransCanada on June 3, 2011 that its
authority under 49 *USC* § 60112 was invoked. This statute "provides
for the issuance of a corrective Order without prior opportunity for
notice and hearing upon a finding that failure to issue the Order
expeditiously will result in likely serious harm to life, property,
or the environment." In the Order issued against TransCanada this
specific safety-related finding was made by US DOT PHMSA:

**...I find that the continued operation of the pipeline without
corrective measures would be hazardous to life, property and the
environment. Additionally, after considering the circumstances
surrounding the May 7 and May 29, 2011 failures, the proximity of the
pipeline to populated areas, water bodies, public roadways and high
consequence areas, the hazardous nature of the product the pipeline
transports, the**

**ongoing investigation to determine the cause of the failures, and
the potential for the conditions causing the failures to be present
elsewhere on the pipeline, I find that a failure to issue this Order
expeditiously to require immediate corrective action would result in
likely serious harm to life, property and the environment. Accordingly,
this Corrective Action Order mandating immediate corrective action
is issued without prior notice and opportunity for hearing.**

68. The PHMSA official who signed the June 3 Order made its terms
effective immediately.74 Analysis of the terms disclose both the
nature and scope of federal oil pipeline safety regulation, and helps
to distinguish pipeline *safety* from pipeline *siting* concerns. When
sited in locations approved by the State as appropriate to the State's
overall land use and growth plan, the pipeline must be built and
operated safely. Safety and siting are different concerns. The PHMSA
safety-related Order issued to TransCanada in 2011 due to spills from
its existing line clearly applied without concern about the pipeline's
site or location. The Order required75:

68.1 TransCanada to submit a written re-start plan or approval before
re- energizing the line.

68.2 The re-start plan had to include at least these steps and provide
adequate staffing, monitoring, and patrolling during restart to ensure
no leaks or failures at any pumping station.

68.3 Prior to re-start, TransCanada had to complete required
mechanical and metallurgical testing and failure analysis of failed
pipe components. Within sixty (60) days after issuance of the Order,
a review of Keystone facilities is required. It must contain this
extensive data:

68.3.1 It was required to compile all available data on previous
failures of similar small diameter piping and components.

68.3.2 It was ordered to compare a list by location that includes
all sizes of pipes, sizes of components, etc.

74 Order, June 3, 2011, PHMSA, available at
http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Keystone%20CAO%20and%20Restart%20A
pproval.pdf

75 *Id.*

68.4 Within forty-five (45) days of the Order, an automated tracking
system called Issues and Incident Tracker, was required to disclose
by location previous difficulties.

68.5 The company was ordered to compile all media data or other
documents to support its version of what went wrong.

69. Obviously, the PHMSA Order was not dependent on the whereabouts of
TransCanada's pipeline. The Order was about the pipeline's structural
integrity, construction, and maintenance. The corrective Order could
have been issued if the pipeline was located in central Nebraska, or
eastern Nebraska, when it entered the State, and whether it exited,
in its southbound route, in Jefferson County or Richardson County.

70. State regulation dealing with where the pipeline should go does
not interfere with federal regulation of pipeline safety. Further,
while some Nebraskans might be vitally interested in protecting against
pipeline spills that could taint the Aquifer or damage the Sandhills,
these are land use issues, not pipeline safety issues like those
regulated by PHMSA and the Department of Transportation. Protective
land use regulations are not at variance with the regulatory scheme
of the DOT and its PHMSA.

**Pipeline *Safety* Is Preempted by Federal Law, but *Siting* Is
Not Preempted**

71. Oil pipeline siting is not federally preempted. Oil pipeline safety
is preempted. Virtually everyone except TransCanada's lawyers hired to
write papers for the company's public relations use in Nebraska have
so concluded. Those reaching this conclusion include State agencies,76
scholars,77 scholarly think-tanks,78 and federal agency researchers.79

72. Congressional researchers have reached the same conclusion.80 In
view of the uniform results of studies conducted for the US Congress,
this conclusion is inescapable about oil pipelines because it is
accurate:

**Siting Authority.** A company seeking to construct a CO2 pipeline
must secure siting approval from the relevant regulatory authorities
and must subsequently secure rights of way from landowners along the
pipeline right by purchasing easements or by eminent domain. However,
since federal agencies claim no regulatory authority with respect to
CO2 pipeline construction, potential builders of new CO2 pipelines
do not require, and could not obtain, federal approval to construct
new pipelines. Likewise, federal regulators claim no eminent domain
authority for pipeline construction, and so cannot ensure that pipeline
companies can secure rights of way to construct new pipelines. By
contrast, companies seeking to build interstate *natural gas*
pipelines must first obtain certificates of public convenience and
necessity from FERC under the Natural Gas Act (15 USC §§ 717, et
seq.). Such certification may include safety and security provisions
with respect to pipeline routing, safety standards and other factors.36
A certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by FERC
(15 USC § 717f(h)) confers eminent domain authority.81

73. Nebraska's State government is empowered to act in the area
of oil pipeline siting, or routing, through the State. It cannot
regulate safety, but can regulate land use within the State. State
interests must be expressed reasonably and be weighed responsibly
against competing interests impacting interstate commerce.

**Nebraska State Interests Weighed**

74. As is demonstrated above, Nebraska's interests in regulating
land use is substantial. This area of government is one in which
the principal of federalism is generally aggressively observed,
and deference to the State interest in controlling its land is given
unless overt federal preemption is present. As is demonstrated above,
the federal interest in oil pipeline safety and federal interests
in interstate commerce can be accommodated by reasonable State land
use regulations. They can include either (a) a construction permit
system that compels pipelines to build in defined corridors and not
in irregular patchwork across the State, or (b) limits a pipeline
company's authority to use the power of eminent domain to compel
pipelines to consolidate their routes into reasonable corridors,
and prevents them from building in multiple spots at odd angles or in
otherwise irregular, redundant, unreasonable, or obstructive locations.

75. Nebraska's vital interests in its land use are especially
pronounced where its most pristine natural resources must be
protected. The Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, as well as the
State's scenic and economically important rivers and lakes, all
require and justify land use protection.

76. First the Sandhills are unique... so much so that it has been
the subject of

Presidential investigations.82 What they hold as answers to questions
residing deep within the minds of people is a matter of ongoing
revelation.83

77. Second, the Ogallala Aquifer is one of the world's largest
aquifers, it covers an area of approximately 174,000 miles.84 It
supplies 70% of all water used in the State of Kansas.85 This is
only a small fraction of total dependence on the Ogallala Aquifer,
which serves as a prime water source for the States of North Dakota,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico,
and Wyoming.86

78. Third, scientists now know that ground and surface water should be
treated as a single hydrological system because that is the way they
behave in nature.87 Nebraska possesses the most valuable portion of
the eight-state High Plains Aquifer---by far the deepest, cleanest
and largest share, a nearly unbelievable two-thirds of the whole.88
Above most of this water is a sea of sandy soils, the Sandhills,
where in many places the water table outcrops into wetlands, rivers
or is not far below.89

79. The TransCanada company wants to install a large-diameter
high-pressure crude oil pipeline---the XL---through 110 miles of this
sensitive, water-rich area, where (because of the soils' porosity
and the close proximity of the water table) both ground

surface water or ground water as if they were separate entities. As
development of land and water resources increases, it is apparent
that development of either of these resources affects the quantity
and quality of the other. Nearly all surface-water features (streams,
lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and estuaries) interact with ground
water...Thus, effective land and water management requires a clear
understanding of the linkages between ground water and surface water
as it applies to any given hydrologic setting." ---Robert M. Hirsch,

88 "In the entire High Plains Aquifer, the place where the
water is deepest is beneath the Sandhills. The key to that water
volume...is that sand is highly permeable; water flows through
it easily..." U.S. Water News Online, December 1996, "Nebraska's

and surface water are particularly vulnerable to widespread, rather
than localized, contamination. It is also an area easily harmed by
"clean-up" activities, where "natural remediation" of toxins over the
course of many decades is likely to produce a dramatic detrimental
impact on the environment. University of Nebraska Water Center
Professor, Dr. John Gates testified under oath at a hearing on
the TransCanada pipeline crossing the Sandhills, in the Nebraska
Legislature, "It is known that surface waters in the Sandhills
region, including rivers, wetlands, and lakes, are extensively fed by
groundwater. ....[T]he time scale of flow from shallow groundwater
to surface water can be very short in the Sandhills. Under these
conditions, an oil release to groundwater that is near to a surface
water body would be difficult to remediate before it is transmitted
to surface.

80. The case for land use regulation of oil pipelines by the State
is clear. The methods available are equally clear. A permit system
can be enacted or, perhaps more simply, the power of eminent domain
can be restricted, to assure that oil pipelines respect Nebraska's
land use priorities, build their assets in controlled corridors, and
comply with reasonable land use criteria, just like other industrial
users of Nebraska's land must. No special burden will be imposed
upon oil pipelines from any such legislation. Pipeline commerce and
interstate benefits will be preserved. No intrastate preference for
local pipelines will be created, and wise land use will be achieved.

81. Importantly, Nebraska's land use priorities can be achieved while
accommodating interstate commerce reasonably. A pipeline company
seeking passage through the State must expect to accommodate the law
of each jurisdiction through which it works, including those laws
that impact land use, taxes, permit requirements, notifications,
disclosures, or siting. Matters of local importance must be respected
and protected. This may require adjustments to routes, changes in
plans and even some adjustments to schedules. But, so long as they
accommodate interstate interests reasonably, the State laws will be
enforced and command respect.

**III. What Authority Authorizes Immediate Action By Executive &
Legislative Branches of Nebraska's State Government?**

**How May Nebraska Act?**

82. Nebraska's right to regulate land use is derived from the
reservation of State powers in the US Constitution. Simply,

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.90

90 *US Const* Amend 10.

The 10th Amendment does not empower States not nullify federal laws
or regulations or federal judicial decisions.91

83. Nebraska's power to act is implemented in the State's Constitution
conferring lawmaking authority on the Legislature,92 and the separation
of powers including duties to execute laws passed by the Legislature.93
Executive departments must not exceed delegated powers or encroach
upon legislative mandates in the implementation of statutes.94 And,
the power to make laws may not be delegated by the Legislature to the
Executive Branch.95 In fact, the Legislature cannot delegate its law
making authority to the United States either.96

84. Rule making authority can be delegated with adequate legislative
standards.97 The policy purposes for the delegation of authority and
the boundaries for action must be established by the Legislature with
the Executive agency's power being confined to implementation.98

85. These background rules and the discussion of federal preemption and
State authority above, provide legal background for the alternatives
available to the Nebraska Legislature as it deals with pipeline
regulatory issues. These options are discussed throughout this Green
Paper, but collected, below.

**IV. What are Nebraska's Options for Action?**

86. Nebraska's land use regulatory authority appears to authorize
action to regulate oil pipelines in these categories or of these
general types:

86.1 State law can, and should define what constitutes a
*pipeline*. The federal definition quoted above at ¶ 26 is
suggested.99

86.2 State law can define a "pipeline *company"* and should do so
to include affiliates, related parties, commonly owned entities,
joint ventures, etc.

91 *Cooper v Aaron*, 358 US 1 (1958). 92 *Neb Const* Art III Sec
1. 93 *Neb Const* Art II Sec 1

94 *Mann v. Wayne County Board of Equalization*, 186 Neb 752, 186 NW2d
729 (1971). 95 *In re Petition of Nebraska Community Corr. Council,*
274 Neb 225, 738 NW2d 850 (2007). 96 *Anderson v. Tiemann*, 182 Neb
393, 155 NW2d 322 (1967); *Smithberger v. Banning*, 129 Neb 651,
262 NW 492 (1935). 97 *School Dist. No. 39 of Washington County
v. Decker*, 159 Neb 693, 68 NW2d 354 (1955). 98 A statute regulating
the size of loaf of bread, authorizing Secretary of Agriculture to
fix reasonable excess tolerances, is not invalid as a delegation of
legislative power. *Petersen Baking Co. v. Bryan*, 124 Neb 464, 247
NW 39 (1933), affirmed, 290 US 570 (1934). 99 The federal definition
is found at 49 *CFR* § 195.2. Definitions.

86.3 State law can prohibit exercise of the power of eminent domain,
or the ownership or operation of a pipeline in Nebraska by a company or
organization with interests inimical to the United States as identified
by the US Department of State or the US Department of Defense or
any other agency authorized by the President of the United States
to publish a list of nation states or organizations with interests
inimical to those of the United States.

86.4 State law can be amended to limit or even eliminate the delegation
of the power of eminent domain to oil pipeline companies, though
tempering the use of the power is preferable to its elimination.

86.5 State law can require that pipeline companies build within
defined corridors through the State, which corridors are defined on
terms consistent with legislatively expressed state land use criteria.

86.6 State law can require that pipeline companies build in existing
easements or rights-of-way held by the company proposing construction,
or in alternative compatible rights of way.

86.7 State law can require that pipeline companies build additional
pipelines in easements or rights-of-way held by the company and can
limit the power of eminent domain to expansion of existing easements
only, if necessary.

86.8 State law can limit the power of eminent domain to construction
in pre-approved corridors or existing easements or rights of way.

86.9 State law can require application and an approval process for
a pipeline construction and / or operating permit as a condition
precedent to exercise of the power of eminent domain.

86.10 State law can require that just compensation include severance
damages where easements or rights-of-way, or partial takings, affect
remainder interests or properties of nearby landowners.

86.11 State law can commit pipeline siting issues to either an
administrative agency, in which case rule making would be required
and lobbying and political influence could be wielded, or to the
judiciary for adjudication of actual cases and controversies where
such influence is minimized.

86.12 State law can regulate the ownership of pipelines by requiring
prior approval before transfer to a successor as it does with State
chartered banks, privately owned utilities, and common carriers.

86.13 State law can criminalize fraudulent efforts to secure title
to land or easements through false representations of the right to
use the power of eminent domain.

86.14 State law can criminalize intentional or willful operations of
a pipeline under unsafe conditions in violation of federal pipeline
safety standards. It can provide for the right of the State to take
over operations of a pipeline declared unsafe and to remediate the
unsafe conditions at the expense of the power, and provide civil
penalties assessed daily and payable to the State.

86.15 State law can provide both compensatory and punitive damages,

with funds for the latter to be paid to a designated State fund,
where an offending pipeline violates the law of Nebraska, constitutes
a public or private nuisance, or proximately causes losses to persons
or property through operations that violate federal safety standards.

86.16 State law can require a remediation plan be filed and approved
as a condition precedent to an operating permit, and it can require
periodic (perhaps decennial) updates for the remediation plan as a
condition precedent to permit renewal at periodic intervals.

86.17 State law can include a pipeline tax imposed as an *ad valorem*
tax based on a formula that may include, among other possible factors,
length, diameter, quantity and type of product transmitted, and other
proper factors.

86.18 State law can be amended to repeal existing pipeline condemnation
authority and replace that authority with an appropriate new
methodology.

87. This list of options is not exclusive. It is illustrative. **When
Does Nebraska Lose the Right to Act?**

88. Once a pipeline company acquires property rights under an
easement, right- of-way, condemnation or deed, it owns interests in
real estate. Those interests are property of the pipeline company; it
is entitled to just compensation if the government takes the property
from it, just as does any other American citizen or any company with
interests here. Property of foreign nations may be taken only for
just compensation and

public purposes permitted by the Fifth Amendment.100 Such takings for
non-public purposes or without just compensation violate federal101
and international law.102

89. The State must act before land is acquired by a pipeline company or
it is likely to lose the right to exercise its sovereign powers. This
means the deadline for State action is before the pipeline route
is acquired from Nebraskans. **Is Nebraska Vulnerable to Suit If it
Exercises Its Sovereignty?**

90. Fear of efforts at reprisal by large companies against the State
exist. Oil pipeline owners are often among the largest companies
in the world, with resources and personnel greater than those of
Nebraska and most States. But, Nebraska has an important protection
that should not be dismissed lightly or overlooked. As a sovereign,
Nebraska is immune from suit except where it waives its immunity.

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against
one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens
or Subjects of any Foreign State."103

91. The Supreme Court has explained the Eleventh Amendments immunity
recently:

Although the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the
Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, "we have
understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it
says, but for the presupposition ... which it confirms." *Blatchford
v. Native Village of Noatak,* 501 U.S. 775, 779, 111 S.Ct. 2578,
2581, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991). That presupposition, first observed
over a century ago in *Hans v. Louisiana,* 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504,
33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), has two parts: first, that each State is a
sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that " '[i]t is
inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit
of an individual without its consent,' " *id.,* at 13, 10 S.Ct.,
at 506 (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487
(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). See also *Puerto Rico Aqueduct
and Sewer Authority, supra,* at 146 ("The Amendment is rooted in
a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain
attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity"). For over
a century we have reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction over suits
against unconsenting States "was not contemplated by the

*USC* 1605(a). *Siderman de Blake v Republic of Argentina,* 965 F2d 699
(9th Cir 2003). 102 *Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of

Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United
States." *Hans, supra,* at 15, 10 S.Ct., at 507.104

92. Nebraska officials can be enjoined from enforcing an
unconstitutional law,105 but the State is not liable for damages
unless it assents to be sued.106

**Conclusion**

93. Nebraska's government is empowered to protect the State's vital
land use interests and natural resources. Available options are
plentiful and reasonable. A long range view of solutions for all
foreseeable pipeline issues, and not a simplistic answer to a single
pressing problem, is respectfully urged.
