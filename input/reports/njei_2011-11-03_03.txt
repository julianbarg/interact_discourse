## Energy Secrity: Good for Nebraska, Good for America

Energy Security Fact:

By 2030, the United States could secure 92 percent of its liquid fuels
from secure sources (i.e. the U.S. and Canada) with access to oil
resources on public lands and in federal waters that are currently
off-limits, and with the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline which
would bring additional supplies from Canada.

### America needs energy

America uses more energy than any nation in the world. Currently, the
U.S. consumes more than 15 million barrels of crude oil each day --
11 million of which are imported. And energy requirements continue to
increase each year. Additional resources will be needed to preserve
this standard of living and consumption.

While renewable energy sources (e.g. wind and solar) continue to be
refined and improved, the reality is that these technologies remain
in their infancy. Alternative energy technologies will continue to be
improved and developed, but we are currently in a transition period
and it could take decades for our reliance on fossil fuels as a major
source of energy to diminish significantly.

The U.S. has a choice. Receive more oil from Canada -- the most
secure, most stable and closest friend and ally it has in the world --
or get its oil from volatile, unstable, and often unfriendly regimes
overseas that do not share America’s values or common interests. The
proposed Keystone XL Pipeline will play an important role in linking
a secure and growing supply of Canadian crude oil with the largest
refining markets in the U.S., significantly improving North American
security supply.

Keystone XL would be the safest, most secure pipeline ever built in
North America.

### Keystone XL : Improving Energy Security for America

By building the Keystone XL Pipeline, TransCanada would increase the
total capacity of the Keystone Pipeline System to 1.3 million barrels
per day. That’s 1.3 million barrels per day of safe, secure, reliable
Canadian crude oil being shipped to refineries in the U.S. Midwest
and Texas -- to be refined in the U.S., create jobs in the U.S. and
be consumed by Americans.

On its own, Keystone XL would provide enough oil to reduce America’s
dependence on oil from hostile regimes in Venezuela and the Middle
East by up to 40 per cent. This is backed up by a December, 2010
U.S. Department of Energy study stating that “Increased Canadian
oil imports will help reduce U.S. imports of foreign oil from sources
outside of North America.”

Currently, Venezuela and Persian Gulf nations ship almost 2.5 million
barrels of oil to the U.S. each day. Keystone XL would be capable
of delivering 900,000 barrels of crude oil from resources in Canada,
the Bakken region in the Dakotas and

### Montana, and Oklahoma. American Oil: Good for America

Keystone XL is not just about moving Canadian oil to
U.S. markets. About a quarter of the pipeline’s capacity would be
dedicated to bringing up to 250,000 barrels of American resources
torefineries along the Keystone System, through the Bakken and
Cushing Marketlinks.

The Bakken Marketlink has signed contracts to ship 65,000 barrels
per day of U.S. crude oil from the Williston Basin, which holds the
Bakken formation in Montana and North Dakota. The Bakken formation
is the only growing source of U.S. crude production.

The Cushing Marketlink would take receipts of up to 150,000 barrels of
crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma for delivery to the Gulf Coast. Cushing
is the largest crude oil storage hub in North America and while
storage has continued to grow, incremental exit pipeline capacity
has not kept pace. There is currently no direct pipeline access from
Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Keystone XL would provide that access.

Energy Security Fact:

Canada supplies more oil to the U.S. than any other country. It
supplies 13 percent of current U.S. petroleum-consumption needs and
represents 20 percent of U.S. petroleum imports.
